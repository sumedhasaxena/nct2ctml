summary: 'This is a comparative study for adult participants with cancer who are suspected
  to have neutropenic fever (or fever with low neutrophil count) in emergency department.
  Neutrophil is a kind of defensive white blood cell combating against infection,
  especially by bacteria and fungi. Low neutrophil can be part of the disease progress
  or secondary to some cancer treatment. These participants are at high risk of developing
  infection-related complications including death.


  Currently a dedicated clinical pathway has been in place in emergency department
  for suspected neutropenic fever, which offers fast-track medical consultation, blood
  tests and a very strong antibiotic (meropenem) as the first choice within 1 hour
  of registration. However, majority of such participants'' neutrophil counts are
  not low. Most of them have no bacterial infection in the body, and have unremarkable
  short hospital stays. Early administration of meropenem in the majority of cases
  may be unnecessary and imposes risk of developing antibiotic resistance.


  This study attempts to answer the question, "In adult participants with cancer presenting
  to emergency department with suspected neutropenic fever, when compared with conventional
  treatment, can a new protocol guided by fast-track neutrophil count reduces prescription
  of meropenem?" Agreed participants will be randomly assigned to the conventional
  treatment group, or the new treatment group. For those who are assigned to the new
  treatment group, blood will be taken and sent to the hospital laboratory for urgent
  analysis of neutrophil count. Participants with proven low neutrophil counts will
  still receive meropenem, while those without low neutrophil counts will receive
  less strong antibiotic according to their clinical diagnoses, such as Augmentin.
  They will be followed up on the first 7 days, and then on the 14th, 30th, 90th,
  and 180th days after recruitment. Comparisons will be made to see how much less
  meropenem will be prescribed, and whether more serious adverse events will happen.
  The study is expected to take 37 months to complete. Duration of data collection,
  including the day of last follow up, is estimated to be 33 months.'

      arm_description: Patient's blood sample will be expedited for complete blood
        count with differentials. Intravenous antibiotic is given depending on absolute
        neutrophil count. If neutropenia is present, broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem
        1 g or levofloxacin 500 mg) will be given after septic workup within 1 hour
        of registration in emergency department before transfer to wards. If absent,
        antibiotic according to "Hospital Authority Interhospital Multi-disciplinary
        Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT)" with reference to previous
        bacterial sensitivity pattern, or amoxiclav 1.2 g if not specified, will be
        given. Other interventions are given according to clinical needs. The regimen
        is continued until clinicians recommend an alternative antimicrobial based
        on clinical grounds, or detection of other pathogens which indicate another
        antimicrobial.

      arm_description: 'The control group refers to the existing clinical pathway
        which guides management of adult patients with suspected NF in ED. Without
        information of absolute neutrophil count, Meropenem 1 g IV bolus (or Levofloxacin
        500 mg IV infusion over 1 hour if Penicillin-allergic) will be given within
        1 hour of ED registration after septic workup. Other interventions are given
        according to clinical needs.


        Subsequent treatment in wards will be determined by doctor''s clinical judgement,
        on a personalised basis. Each patient will be assessed by a parent team member.
        There is no standardised antibiotic de-escalation protocol in place, but it
        is a usual practice to continue Meropenem or Levofloxacin injections until
        clinical improvement, rising ANC, and negative culture results. After that
        it will be replaced with an antibiotic with a narrower spectrum, such as oral
        Amoxiclav, before discharge.'
