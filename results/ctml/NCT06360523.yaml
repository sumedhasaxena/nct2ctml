summary: It is a prospective paired-cohort study for diagnostic test evaluation. The
  study aim to determine the accuracy of AI review and investigate whether AI review
  could detect MRI visible significant cancer as effective as radiologist review.
  MRI image of about 368 men recommended for biopsy will be reviewed by an AI model
  and an experienced radiologist, respectively. AI review (index) and radiologist
  review (standard) will be blinded to each other, while biopsy urologists will be
  well-informed of the findings of both AI review and radiologist review and make
  personalized biopsy plan by combining both findings. The pathological results of
  MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy (reference) will serve as the gold standard to assess
  the diagnostic accuracy.
