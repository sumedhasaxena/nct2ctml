summary: Cancer survivors generally have low physical activity (PA) levels. While
  literature shows some evidence of improvement in PA following technology-based PA
  promotion interventions among cancer survivors, high-quality randomised control
  trials (RCTs), with objective measures of PA and longer-term follow-up, are lacking.
  Using a theoretical framework that addresses action control in addition to intention
  formation may enhance intervention effect. The Multi-process action control (M-PAC)
  framework is an extension of the traditional intention-formation theories, incorporating
  constructs that address the translation of intention into behaviour and continual
  action control. After comprehensively searching, no previous or ongoing RCTs have
  investigated the efficacy of a technology-based PA promotion intervention in cancer
  survivors that is designed based on the M-PAC framework. Investigators therefore
  propose a RCT to evaluate a technology-based intervention (WExercise) to support
  the promotion of PA in cancer survivors.

      arm_description: Participants will receive a written information sheet (i.e.,
        PA guide, safety precautions, and goal) same as the control group. In addition,
        participants in the WExercise group will be provided with 10 weekly technology-based
        classes delivered in a mobile application aimed at promoting PA. Participants
        will be given individualised access to the app. The classes aim at developing
        reflective, regulatory, and reflexive processes of cancer survivors to engage
        in PA based on the M-PAC framework. Participants will be sent reminders (3
        days apart) by WhatsApp/WeChat each time they have a class due.

      arm_description: Participants will receive a one-page written information sheet
        regarding the PA guidelines for cancer survivors and exercise safety precautions
        extracted from the website of the Centre for Health Protection of the HKSAR
        Government. Although mixed aerobic and resistance exercise are recommended,
        participants will be provided with a simple goal of increasing their aerobic
        exercise levels to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes
        of vigorous aerobic exercise per week because resistance exercise requires
        instructions from trained personnel.
