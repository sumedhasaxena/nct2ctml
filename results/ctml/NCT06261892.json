To test the sensitivity and specificity of using HPV DNA from urine for the detection of pre-cervical or/and cervical cancer.\n2. If HPV DNA is not a promising biomarker, other biomarkers will be explored.\n3. To develop an effective and non-invasive detection method of the pre-cervical or/and cervical cancer. in Women with menstruation.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nTo validate whether HPV DNA from urine could be used as a non-invasive means for the detection of pre-cervical or cervical cancer\n\nParticipants will\n\n1. Join the briefing session of the study\n2. Sign the consent form and health questionnaire\n3. Submit the cervical medical report(s) within 3 months or perform sponsored pap smear test\n4. Collect the urine sample\n\nIf there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare The diseased group and the healthy group according to the medical reports they provided to see if HPV DNA from urine is a promising biomarker for the detection of pre-cervical or cervical cancer", "treatment_list": {"step": [{"arm": [{"arm_code": "Collect HPV DNA from urine", "arm_internal_id": 0, "arm_description": {}, "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Diagnostic Test: Collect HPV DNA from urine", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}], "match": [{"and": [{"clinical": {"oncotree_primary_diagnosis": "", "disease_status": ["", ""]}}, {"genomic": {"hugo_symbol": "", "variant_category": ""}}]}]}]}}
