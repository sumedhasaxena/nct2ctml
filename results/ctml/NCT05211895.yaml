prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'INCLUSION CRITERIA:'
- "1. Participant must be \u2265 18 years at the time of screening."
- 2. Histologically- or cytologically-documented NSCLC and have been treated with
  concurrent CRT for locally advanced, unresectable (Stage III) disease
- 3. Provision of a tumour tissue sample obtained prior to CRT
- "4. Documented tumour PD-L1 status \u2265 1% by central lab"
- 5. Documented EGFR and ALK wild-type status (local or central).
- 6. Patients must not have progressed following definitive, platinum-based, concurrent
  chemoradiotherapy
- 7. Participants must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy
  concurrent with radiation therapy
- "8. Participants must have received a total dose of radiation of 60 Gy \xB110% (54\
  \ Gy to 66 Gy) as part of the chemoradiation therapy, to be randomised. Radiation\
  \ therapy should be administered by intensity modulated RT (preferred) or 3D-conforming\
  \ technique."
- 9. WHO performance status of 0 or 1 at randomization
- 10. Adequate organ and marrow function
- 'EXCLUSION CRITERIA:'
- '1. History of another primary malignancy, except for:'
- '* Malignancies treated with curative intent and adequate follow-up with no known
  active disease and have not required active treatment within the past 3 years before
  the first dose of study intervention and of low potential risk of recurrence.'
- '* Adequately resected non melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
  of disease .'
- '* Adequately treated carcinoma in situ, including Ta tumors without evidence of
  disease.'
- 2. Mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology.
- 3. Participants who receive sequential (not inclusive of induction) chemoradiation
  therapy for locally advanced (Stage III) unresectable NSCLC.
- 4. Participants with locally advanced (Stage III) unresectable NSCLC who have progressed
  during platinum-based cCRT.
- 5. Any unresolved toxicity CTCAE \>Grade 2 from the prior chemoradiation therapy
  (excluding alopecia).
- "6. Participants with \u2265 grade 2 pneumonitis from prior chemoradiation therapy."
- "7. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic\
  \ pneumonitis - regardless of time of onset prior to randomisation. Evidence of\
  \ active non-CRT induced pneumonitis (\u2265 Grade 2), active pneumonia, active\
  \ ILD, active or recently treated pleural effusion, or current pulmonary fibrosis"
- 8. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (with exceptions)
- 9. Active EBV infection, or known or suspected chronic active EBV infection at screening
- 10. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the
  first dose of durvalumab.

summary: This is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre,
  international study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and
  domvanalimab (AB154) compared with durvalumab plus placebo in adults with locally
  advanced (Stage III), unresectable NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following
  definitive platinum-based cCRT.
