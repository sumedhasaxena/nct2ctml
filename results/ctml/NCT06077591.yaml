summary: Precision oncology aims to improve clinical outcome of patients by offering
  personalized treatment through identifying druggable genomic aberrations within
  their tumors. This is particularly valid when it comes to offering alternative treatment
  options for patients with advanced tumors that are chemo-refractory. Patient-derived
  organoids (PDOs) are 3 dimensional tumoroids that can be expanded ex vivo and are
  both pheno- and genotypically identical to patients' tumors. Observational studies
  have shown that PDO-based drug screens can predict treatment response with high
  sensitivity and specificity. Vlachogiannis G. reported a living biobank of patient-derived
  organoids (PDOs) from patients with advanced GI cancers enrolled in clinical trials.
  PDOs can recapitulate patients' clinical response to chemotherapeutic agents. In
  19 tumor organoids, the group performed molecular profiling and drug screens and
  then compared ex vivo organoid responses to anticancer drugs. Drug response to PDO
  based orthotopic mouse tumor xenografts correlated to the drug response of the patient
  in clinical trials. Further to the study, there were other retrospective validation
  studies utilizing PDOs from patients enrolled in clinical trials such as the TUMOROID,
  CinClare to predict clinical response. Ooft studied PDOs from patients with metastatic
  colorectal cancers enrolled in the TUMOROID study to predict response to irinotecan-based
  therapies. Yao generated a organoid biobank of 80 locally advanced rectal cancers.
  These patients were derived from a phase III study (CinClare) that compared neoadjuvant
  chemo-radiation using either capecitabine or CAPIRI. Response to chemoradiation
  in patients matched to that of rectal cancer organoids (sensitivity 78% and specificity
  91.9%). In a systematic analysis of 17 studies (9 on advanced GI and pancreatic
  cancers, one on renal cell cancer and others on miscellaneous cancers), the pooled
  sensitivity and specificity for discriminating patients with a clinical response
  through PDO-based drug screen was 0.81 (95%CI 0.69-0.89) and 0.74 (95%CI 0.64-0.82)
  respectively. Within 4-6 weeks, PDO-based drug screen creates a true personalised
  platform by predicting patient-specific drug response with high accuracy. Recent
  technical advancements in growing these PDO 'avatars' from biopsies have made it
  possible to test suitable anticancer drugs in patients with advanced inoperable
  tumors, and explore the new possibilities for treatment options that otherwise would
  be missed by standard conventional therapies. In 2019, our group embarked on PDO
  research; investigators obtained tissues from patients with advanced/ inoperable
  solid tumors, and performing drug screens on these PDOs ex vivo. In several patients,
  investigators were able to identified drugs not otherwise used through sequencing
  data, and observed remarkable clinical response in patients with PDO responsive
  tumors. Investigators illustrate with cases that underwent PDO culture and drug
  screens. \[ See appendix \] In the literature, the clinical utility of treatment
  based on PDO informed drug options has however not been fully established. Investigators
  therefore propose a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate efficacy
  of NGS/ PDO guided treatment in patients with inoperable or metastatic solid tumors..

      arm_description: Intervention in this study is to perform tissue sampling to
        patient's tumor which are then subjected to DNA extraction for whole exome
        sequencing, organoid culture, and drug screen. An MDT board will review the
        drug screen results and excluded drug choice of poor response. Then the referring
        oncologist has the final discretion on the choice of chemo- or targeted agent
        as usual.
