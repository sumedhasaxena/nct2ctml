summary: The main purpose of this study is to measure how well imlunestrant works
  compared to standard hormone therapy in participants with early breast cancer that
  is estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal receptor 2 negative (HER2-).
  Participants must have already taken endocrine therapy for two to five years and
  must have a higher-than-average risk for their cancer to return. Study participation
  could last up to 10 years.
