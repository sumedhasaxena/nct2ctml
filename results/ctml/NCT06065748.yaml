prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast, not amenable to
  treatment with curative intent'
- '* Documented estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2-negative (HER2-) tumor assessed
  locally on the most recent tumor biopsy (or an archived tumor sample if a recent
  tumor sample is not available for testing)'
- '* Confirmed ESR1 mutation status (ESR1m versus ESR1nmd) in baseline circulating
  tumor DNA (ctDNA) through central laboratory testing'
- '* Resistance to prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), which is defined as having
  relapsed with prior standard adjuvant ET, on-treatment after \>/=12 months or off-treatment
  within 12 months of completion. Prior use of adjuvant CDK4/6i is allowed (if relapse
  occurred \>/=12 months since completion).'

  with approved LHRH agonist therapy (as per local guidelines) for the duration of
  study treatment'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Prior systemic therapy (e.g., prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or
  biologic therapy) for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with another SERD (e.g., fulvestrant, oral SERDs) or
  novel ER-targeting agents
- Exclude - * Advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread that is at risk of life-threatening
  complications in the short term
- Exclude - * Active cardiac disease or history of cardiac dysfunction
- Exclude - * Clinically significant history of liver disease

summary: This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label multicenter study that will evaluate
  the efficacy and safety of giredestrant compared with fulvestrant, both in combination
  with the investigator's choice of a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib, ribociclib or
  abemaciclib), in participants with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have developed
  resistance to adjuvant endocrine therapy.
