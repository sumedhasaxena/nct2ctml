summary: 'The primary objective of Parts 1 and 2 of this study is to evaluate the
  safety, tolerability, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
  phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG 193 alone and in combination with docetaxel in adult
  participants with metastatic or locally advanced methylthioadenosine phosphorylase
  (MTAP)-null solid tumors.


  The primary objective of Part 3 of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG
  193 in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced MTAP-null solid tumors.'
