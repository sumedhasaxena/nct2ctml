summary: The study aims to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended combination
  dose of the MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor AMG 193 administered in combination
  with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced methylthioadenosine
  phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted gastrointestinal, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancers.
  The study also aims to determine the safety profile of AMG 193 administered in combination
  with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced MTAP-deleted
  gastrointestinal, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancers.
