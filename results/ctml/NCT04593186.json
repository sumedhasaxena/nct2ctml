The small caliber endoscope provides only a limited view of the nasopharynx and may not be able to provide a thorough assessment of the nasopharynx. The investigators have developed a novel endoscopic approach to access the nasopharynx by using a trans-oral high definition endoscope with magnification and image enhancement function. In this cohort study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of diagnosing NPC by applying the novel technique in a high risk patient group with elevated plasma EBV DNA but with negative screening with conventional trans-nasal endoscopy.", "treatment_list": {"step": [{"arm": [{"arm_code": "Trans-oral magnifying endoscopy with NBI", "arm_internal_id": 0, "arm_description": "Transoral magnifying endoscopy with High Definition Upper Endoscope with Narrow Band Imaging enhancement (Olympus GIF-H290Z)", "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Procedure: Trans-oral magnifying endoscopy with NBI", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}], "match": [{"and": [{"clinical": {"oncotree_primary_diagnosis": "", "disease_status": ["", ""]}}, {"genomic": {"hugo_symbol": "", "variant_category": ""}}]}]}]}}
