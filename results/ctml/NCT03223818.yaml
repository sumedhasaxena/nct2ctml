summary: 'Liver cancer was the third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes in
  Hong Kong and liver resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment. Post-operative
  recovery from liver resection has historically been fraught with a high incidence
  of complications, ranging from 15-48%, and the high incidence of complications leads
  to prolonged hospital stay, ranging from 9 - 15 days, and increase costs of hospitalization.
  Recent advancement in the perioperative surgical and anesthetic management of patients
  undergoing liver resection has led to improvement in these outcomes.


  The investigators department had previously studied the impact and confirmed the
  benefit of fast-track peri-operative programs after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
  Nevertheless, studies regarding its adoption in liver resection are limited. The
  investigators group had previously reported, in a retrospective cohort, that successful
  implementation of ERAS protocol was associated with a significantly shorten hospital
  stay. However, the peri-operative management in that study incorporated a small
  proportion of components described in ERAS programs for liver resection and there
  was no direct comparison with conventional peri-operative program.


  The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and immunological outcomes of Hong
  Kong Chinese patients undergoing liver resection for liver cancer with a "conventional"
  vs a "fast-track" perioperative program.'
