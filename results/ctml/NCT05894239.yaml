  breast with metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to curative resection'
- '* Confirmation of HER2 biomarker eligibility based on valid results from central

summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of inavolisib in combination
  with Phesgo (pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and rHuPH20 injection for subcutaneous use)
  compared with placebo in combination with Phesgo, as maintenance therapy, after
  induction therapy in participants with previously untreated HER2-positive advanced
  breast cancer (ABC).
