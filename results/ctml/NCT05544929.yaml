prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Non-small cell lung cancer with historic PD-L1 \u2265 1%, as determined locally\
  \ using a clinically accepted assay. Patients must have experienced benefit from\
  \ previous anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy for at least 4 months based on investigator-assessed\
  \ disease stability or response prior to developing documented disease progression.\
  \ Patients must have also received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, either in\
  \ combination or in sequence with anti-PD-(L)1, unless patient was ineligible to\
  \ receive such treatment."
- '* Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell histology, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing
  therapy and a VEGF targeted therapy as monotherapy or in combination. Patients should
  have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy.'
- '* Cutaneous melanoma, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy. Patients
  should have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy.
  Patients with BRAF V600-mutant melanoma must have also received prior therapy with
  a BRAF V600 inhibitor, with or without a MEK inhibitor.'
- "* Ovarian cancer, high-grade serous histology, na\xEFve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy,\
  \ must have received one prior systemic therapy in platinum-resistant setting."
- "* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-keratinizing locally advanced recurrent or metastatic.\
  \ Depending on the study arm, patients may be na\xEFve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy, or\
  \ previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with or without anti-PD-(L)1."
- '* Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer, ovarian
  cancer (high-grade serous histology), anal cancer (squamous), MSI-H CRC, esophagogastric
  cancer, mesothelioma, and HNSCC.'
- "* Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic anal cancer (squamous), thymic carcinoma,\
  \ MSI-H CRC, esophagogastric cancer, mesothelioma, and HNSCC, all na\xEFve to anti-PD(L)1\
  \ therapy and for whom anti PD(L)1 therapy is not available."
- "* Triple negative breast cancer with historic PD-L1 CPS \u2265 1%, must have received\
  \ at least one line of chemotherapy. In addition, these patients must have previously\
  \ received sacituzumab govitecan, and in the case of a BRCA mutation a PARP inhibitor,\
  \ if these treatments are locally approved and accessible to the patient."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.
- Exclude - * Use of agents known to prolong the QT interval unless they can be permanently
  discontinued for the duration of study.
- Exclude - * History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any ingredient of study
  drug(s) and other mAbs and/or their excipients.
- Exclude - * Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo,
  type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis
  not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur may be considered.
  Patients previously exposed to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who are adequately treated
  for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.
- Exclude - * Any evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, or a
  prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring high-dose glucocorticoids.
- Exclude - * Patients who discontinued prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy due to an anti-PD-(L)1-related
  toxicity (applicable to the KFA115 in combination with pembrolizumab treatment arms).
- Exclude - * Patients with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy limiting instrumental
  activities of daily living.
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
