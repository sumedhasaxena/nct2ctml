summary: The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer is expanding in the
  recent decade. Patients with good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy could benefit
  from de-escalation of breast and axilla operation. However, breast tumor and involved
  axillary lymph node should be marked before the commencement of chemotherapy. This
  could facilitate subsequent operative planning and intraoperative assessment of
  disease response. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of magnetic marker
  localization for non-palpable breast cancer and targeted axillary dissection in
  patients with node-positive breast cancer following neoadjuvant therapy
