summary: 'This study evaluates KRT-232, a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of MDM2,
  for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis (MF) who no longer benefit from
  treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Inhibition of MDM2 is a novel mechanism of action
  in MF.


  This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 2 will determine the KRT-232 recommended
  dose and dosing schedule; Phase 3 will test KRT-232 vs Best Available Therapy (BAT).
  Patients in the Phase 3 part of the study will be randomized 2:1 to receive either
  KRT-232 (Arm 1) or BAT (Arm 2). The BAT administered will be determined by the treating
  physician, with the option to "cross-over" to KRT-232 treatment after 6 months of
  BAT or if the disease worsens at any time.'
