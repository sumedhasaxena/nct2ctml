summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is


  1. To test the sensitivity and specificity of using ACTN4 from menstrual blood for
  the detection of pre-cervical or/and cervical cancer.

  2. If ACTN4 is not a promising biomarker, other biomarkers will be explored.

  3. To develop an effective and non-invasive detection method for pre-cervical or/and
  cervical cancer.


  in Women with menstruation.


  The main question it aims to answer is:


  To validate whether menstrual blood could be used as a non-invasive means for the
  detection of pre-cervical or cervical cancer


  Participants will


  1. Join the briefing session of the study

  2. Sign the consent form and health questionnaire

  3. Submit the cervical medical report(s) within 3 months or perform sponsored pap
  smear test

  4. Collect the menstrual blood sample


  If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare The diseased group and
  the healthy group according to the medical reports they provided to see if ACTN4
  from menstrual blood is a promising biomarker for the detection of pre-cervical
  or cervical cancer'
