  and signed before the enrollment and before any exam required by the trial
- 4. Localized low or intermediate risk prostate cancer diagnosed on MRI-Ultrasound
  fusion targeted biopsy
- 5. Organ-confined prostate cancer on MRI

  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \<50 ml/min)
- Exclude - 3. Patients with coagulopathy that cannot be corrected
- Exclude - 4. Patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelets that cannot be stopped
