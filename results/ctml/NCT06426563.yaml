summary: 'Thyroid nodule is a common condition that affects up to 60% of the population.
  There is an estimated 10% lifetime probability of developing a thyroid nodule. Although
  most thyroid nodules are benign, up to 10-15% can enlarge to cause compressive symptoms
  including neck pressure and discomfort, dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia. The conventional
  treatment for these benign but problematic nodules has been thyroidectomy. Although
  generally a low risk operation, thyroidectomy is associated with some risk for recurrent
  laryngeal nerve injury, bleeding, infection, and need for thyroid hormone supplementation.
  Since the early 2000s, ultrasound-guided percutaneous thermal ablation has emerged
  as a potential alternative treatment to surgery for benign thyroid nodules. Of the
  myriad ablation methods, the most commonly used techniques are radiofrequency ablation
  (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). \[1-3\] A growing body of evidence shows that
  RFA is an effective treatment for benign solid thyroid nodules, toxic adenomas,
  and thyroid cysts resulting in overall volume reduction ranges of 40-80% at 1 year,
  with durable resolution of compressive and hyperthyroid symptoms. However, RFA is
  not without its limitations. Radiofrequency waves can be limited by the heat sink
  effect and tissue char leading to longer procedure times and potentially less optimal
  outcomes in larger, hypervascular, and/or more cystic nodules.


  Microwave ablation (MWA) is another ablative technique that uses electromagnetic
  energy waves to cause tissue hyperthermia and coagulative necrosis. It generally
  causes higher ablation temperatures than RFA and is less subject to the heat sink
  effect, and therefore can facilitate more efficient ablation procedures. Current
  evidence comparing RFA versus MWA for thyroid ablation was limited and was either
  retrospective, non-randomized \[4-9\], under-powered, or with an unequal baseline.
  The results from these studies were also conflicting, suggesting suboptimal quality
  of evidence and bias due to non-standardized technique of ablation across studies.
  To date, there is no randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety
  of RFA versus MWA for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. Given the higher
  ablation temperatures, freedom from heat sink effect, and no influence from impedance
  changes during ablation, MWA may achieve different treatment efficacy.'
