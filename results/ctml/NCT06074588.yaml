  for resection or curative radiation) or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with specific
  mutations.'
- '* Documentation of locally assessed radiological disease progression while on or
  after last treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version
  (RECIST) 1.1.'

  on or after EGFR TKI.'

- '* Archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core, incisional, or excisional
  biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated has been provided'
- "* Participants who have AEs due to previous anticancer therapies must have recovered\
  \ to Grade \u22641 or baseline."
- '* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible
  if they have received HBV antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks, and have undetectable
  HBV viral load prior to randomization.'
- '* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants must have well controlled
  HIV on antiretroviral therapy.'
- '* Have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 within 3 days before randomization.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has predominantly squamous cell histology NSCLC.
- Exclude - * Has mixed tumor(s) with small cell elements.
- Exclude - * Has active inflammatory bowel disease requiring immunosuppressive medication
  or previous history of inflammatory bowel disease.
- "Exclude - * Has Grade \u22652 peripheral neuropathy."
- Exclude - * Has history of documented severe dry eye syndrome, severe Meibomian
  gland disease and/or blepharitis, or corneal disease that prevents/delays corneal
  healing.
- Exclude - * Has uncontrolled, significant cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular
  disease.
- Exclude - * Has an EGFR T790M mutation and has not received a third generation EGFR
  TKI (eg, osimertinib).
- Exclude - * Received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational
  agents within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) before randomization.
- Exclude - * Received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the
  first dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Completed palliative radiotherapy within 7 days of the first dose. Participants
  must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities and not require corticosteroids.
- Exclude - * Received radiation therapy to the lung that is \>30 Gy within 6 months

  antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).
- Exclude - * Received prior treatment with a topoisomerase I-containing ADC.
- Exclude - * Has received an investigational agent or has used an investigational
  device within 4 weeks prior to study intervention administration.
- Exclude - * Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active
  treatment within the past 3 years.
- Exclude - * Active infection requiring systemic therapy.
- Exclude - * History of noninfectious pneumonitis/ILD that required steroids or has
  current pneumonitis/ILD.
- Exclude - * Has known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous
  meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate
  provided they are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks, and are off steroids 3
  days prior to dosing with study medication.
- Exclude - * HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or
  Multicentric Castleman's Disease.
- Exclude - * Concurrent active Hepatitis B (defined as HBsAg positive and/or detectable
  HBV DNA) and Hepatitis C virus (defined as anti-HCV Ab positive and detectable HCV
  RNA) infection.

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate sacituzumab tirumotecan versus
  chemotherapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed) for the treatment of previously-treated non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with exon 19del or exon 21 L858R EGFR mutations (hereafter
  referred to as EGFR mutations or EGFR-mutated) or any of the follow genomic alterations:
  ALK gene rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, BRAF V600E mutations, NTRK gene fusions,
  MET exon 14 skipping mutations, RET rearrangements, or less common EGFR point mutations
  of exon 20 S768I, exon 21 L861Q, or exon 18 G719X mutations. The primary hypotheses
  are that sacituzumab tirumotecan is: (1) superior to chemotherapy with respect to
  progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR in NSCLC with
  EGFR mutations; and (2) superior to chemotherapy with respect to overall survival
  (OS) in NSCLC with EGFR mutations.'

      arm_description: Participants will receive 4 mg/kg of sacituzumab tirumotecan
        via intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 15 and 29 of each 6-week cycle. Additionally,
        participants receive diphenhydramine (or equivalent), an H2 antagonist of
        investigator's choice, acetaminophen (or equivalent), and dexamethasone (or
        equivalent) per each drug's product label prior to the first 4 infusions of
        sacituzumab tirumotecan. At subsequent infusions, the H2 antagonist and dexamethasone
        are optional, at the discretion of the investigator.
