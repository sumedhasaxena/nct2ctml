prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion criteria:'
- 1. Signed and dated written informed consent form (ICF) in accordance with International
  Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human
  Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local legislation prior to admission
  to the trial.
- "2. Patients \u226518 years of age or over the legal age of consent in countries\
  \ where that is greater than 18 years at the time of signature of the ICF."
- 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced and/or metastatic
  non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- 4. Documented Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutation in the Tyrosine
  kinase domain (TKD) as per local lab results.
- 5. An archival tumor tissue sample must be submitted to the central laboratory after
  inclusion of the patient to retrospectively confirm the HER2 status. If no archival
  tissue is available, this may be acceptable in exceptional cases after written agreement
  with the sponsor.
- 6. Patients who have not received any systemic treatment for unresectable, locally
  advanced or metastatic disease and are not eligible for curative therapy.
- 7. Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to Response evaluation criteria
  in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as determined by the local site investigator/radiology
  assessment.
- 8. Eligible to receive treatment with the selected platinum-based doublet-chemotherapy
  (i.e. cisplatin/pemetrexed or carboplatin/pemetrexed) and pembrolizumab in accordance
  with the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC)/Product Information.
- Further inclusion criteria apply.
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- 1. Previous or concomitant malignancies other than the one treated in this trial
  within the last 5 years, except;
- '* effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers'
- '* effectively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix'
- '* effectively treated ductal carcinoma in situ'
- '* other effectively treated malignancy that is considered cured by local treatment'
- 2. Tumors with targetable alterations with approved available therapy.
- 3. Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant severe illness based on investigators
  assessment.
- 4. Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or
  any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.
- 5. Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within
  4 weeks prior to randomization or planned within 6 months after screening, e.g.
  hip replacement.
- 6. Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
  would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the trial or interfere with
  the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the test drug.
- "7. History or presence of cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension,\
  \ congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of \u2265\
  \ III or IV, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia which are considered\
  \ as clinically relevant by the investigator. Myocardial infarction, stroke, or\
  \ pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to randomization."
- 8. Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in rhythm,
  conduction, or morphology of resting electrocardiograms, e.g. complete left bundle
  branch block, third degree heart block.
- Further exclusion criteria apply.

summary: 'This study is open to adults 18 years and older with advanced or metastatic
  non-small cell lung cancer. People can join the study if they have tumours with
  HER2 mutations and have not yet received any systemic therapy including chemotherapy
  for advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out
  whether a medicine called zongertinib (BI 1810631) can slow down the worsening of
  advanced non-small cell lung cancer better than the standard treatment available.
  Zongertinib may slow cancer cell growth by inhibiting HER2. This would prolong cancer
  re-occurrence and increase survival. Current standard treatment is pembrolizumab
  plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.


  Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group receives zongertinib at
  regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab,
  pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed
  chemotherapy) into a vein.


  Participants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time,
  they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors
  regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of
  the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12
  weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the
  body. The doctors also regularly check participants'' health and take note of any
  unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between
  the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works. The participants also fill in questionnaires
  about their symptoms and quality of life.'
