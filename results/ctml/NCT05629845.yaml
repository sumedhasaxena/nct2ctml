summary: Rebleeding rate is high in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with variceal
  bleeding despite conventional endoscopic therapies for esophageal and gastric varices
  (EV, GV). Secondary prevention of variceal rebleeding was reported to improve outcomes
  of HCC patients, but the optimal endoscopic approach is not well defined. In this
  difficult-to-manage population, variceal rebleeding rates remain substantial after
  conventional endoscopic therapies. n recent studies by others and our group on direct
  EUS-guided therapy for varices in cirrhotic patients, high technical success (90
  - 100%), low post-treatment rebleeding rate (3 - 11%) and low adverse event rate
  (\~3%) have been reported for GV treatment by cyanoacrylate glue injection, coiling
  or a combination of both, and for cyanoacrylate glue injection or coiling of EV
  refractory to variceal band ligation (VBL). This study aims to compare rebleeding
  rates after secondary prevention by EUS-guided therapy or conventional endoscopic
  therapy in HCC patients with recent variceal bleeding.

      arm_description: "EUS would be performed with a curvilinear echoendoscope based\
        \ on protocol described in our prior study. Because EUS-guided glue injection\
        \ can be applied to both EV and GV and is less technically demanding than\
        \ coiling or the combination approach, it is chosen as the EUS guided intervention\
        \ in our study. The target EV or GV size will be measured by the caliper function\
        \ on the EUS machine. After confirmation of blood flow in the target varix\
        \ by Doppler, EUS-guided glue injection would be performed for EV or GV \u2265\
        \ 3mm in diameter using a standard 19G needle. Each injection will contain\
        \ a 1.2ml mixture of 0.5ml glue (Histoacryl, n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, B. Braun\
        \ Surgical, Germany) + 0.7ml lipiodol. Flow obliteration in the treated varix\
        \ will be confirmed on EUS Doppler. If blood flow is still observed on Doppler\
        \ after the first injection, additional injection of glue-lipiodol mixture\
        \ would be repeated (up to 4 doses) until flow obliteration is achieved."

      arm_description: In patients with prior EV bleeding, EV with high-risk stigmata
        (regardless of size) or EV of medium or large size detected on study EGD will
        be treated with VBL using a multi-band ligator fitted on the gastroscope for
        secondary prevention. In patients with prior GV bleeding, if compressible
        GV suggestive of incomplete obliteration from prior glue treatment is noted
        on study EGD, cyanoacrylate glue injection using a 1.2ml mixture of 0.5ml
        glue (Histoacryl, n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, B. Braun Surgical, Germany) + 0.7ml
        lipiodol will be performed for secondary prevention.
