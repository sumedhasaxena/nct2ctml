summary: "This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the detection of clinically\
  \ significant prostate cancer (csPCa) by MRI-targeted approach (MRI-arm) versus\
  \ 24-core transperineal (TP) systematic biopsy (TP-arm). Clinically significant\
  \ prostate cancer (csPCa) is defined as ISUP (International Society of Urogenital\
  \ Pathology) Grade group \u22652 prostate cancer. Patients with elevated PSA 4-20\
  \ ng/mL with or without abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) will be randomized\
  \ in a 1:1 manner to MRI-arm or TP-arm. In the MRI-arm, multiparametric MRI prostate\
  \ will be performed for each subject. MRI prostate is considered abnormal if PI-RADS\
  \ (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System, version 2.1) score is 3, 4 or 5.\
  \ For subjects in MRI-arm with abnormal MRI, MRI-targeted biopsy will be performed,\
  \ followed by 12-core systematic transperineal biopsy (sparing MRI-target). For\
  \ subjects in MRI-arm with normal MRI, no biopsy is performed. For subjects in TP-arm,\
  \ 24-core systematic transperineal biopsy will be performed without MRI guidance.\
  \ The study flowchart is provided in Figure 1. The detection rates of csPCa will\
  \ be compared between MRI-targeted biopsy plus 12-core systematic biopsy (in MRI-arm)\
  \ versus TP-arm. The study hypothesis is MRI-guided prostate biopsy with 12-core\
  \ systematic biopsy is superior to 24-core transperineal systematic biopsy in detection\
  \ of csPCa."
