summary: "The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of a 16-week combined\
  \ qigong and acupressure intervention on reducing self-reported chemotherapy-induced\
  \ peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity, objective measures of CIPN severity, lower-extremity\
  \ functioning, handgrip strength, fall incidence, and health-related quality of\
  \ life post-intervention among post-chemotherapy adult cancer patients. This will\
  \ be a 2-arm assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial that will follow the CONSORT\
  \ guidelines. A total of 104 cancer patients aged \u226518 who have completed neurotoxic\
  \ chemotherapy at least 1 month prior to enrolment and experiencing CIPN will be\
  \ recruited and randomized into combined qigong and self-administered acupressure\
  \ intervention and wait-list control groups. The intervention group comprises of\
  \ twice-weekly supervised group sessions and three times-weekly self-practice prescription\
  \ (30 min each time) on days without group sessions. The control group will be offered\
  \ a free modality of their choice after the last follow-up. The participants will\
  \ receive usual care alone during the study period."

      arm_description: The intervention will last 16 weeks, including twice-weekly
        supervised group sessions. The first 8 weeks will focus on training of qigong
        Baduanjin and self-administered acupressure. The duration of each group session
        will be 90 min. From week 9 onwards, the group sessions will be shortened
        to 60 min twice a week led by the BQ master. For self-practice prescription,
        participants will be instructed to practice the combined BQ and acupressure
        intervention three times a week (30 min each time) on the days without group
        sessions.
