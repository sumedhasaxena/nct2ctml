summary: Lung cancer screening is currently not recommended in non-smokers due to
  paucity of evidence. Emerging evidence suggests that first-degree family history
  is a strong risk factor for lung cancer in Asian non-smokers. In Asia, lack of resource
  is a major challenge in successful implementation of lung cancer screening. Artificial
  intelligence (AI) is a promising tool to overcome this resource. In this study,
  we aim to study the clinical utility and demonstrate the feasibility of using an
  AI assisted programme for lung cancer screening in Asian non-smokers with a positive
  family history. This is a single-arm non-randomized lung cancer screening study.
  1000 non-smokers, age 50 to 75 year old, with a first-degree family history of lung
  cancer, will be enrolled. Participants will undergo low does computed tomography
  (LDCT) of thorax and blood taking at enrolment. LDCT films will be interpreted by
  AI softwares for presence of lung nodules. Participants with lung nodules will be
  further investigated and followed up according to the risk of malignancy. The primary
  endpoint is the prevalence of early-staged lung cancer detected by first-round LDCT
  thorax in this population.

      arm_description: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been demonstrated
        to function well and complement radiologists as second or concurrent readers
        in pulmonary nodule detection. AI Lung nodule detection and quantification
        solution are now widely used in the hospitals in the United Kingdom and at
        least eight other European countries. The sensitivity of nodule detection
        by radiologists increased from 72% to 80% with the aid of the AI programme.
        A clinical trial in Taiwan showed that using AI programme alone achieved an
        overall sensitivity of 95.6% in nodule detection, and superior performance
        in detecting nodule sized 4-5 mm comparing to radiologists. Overall, application
        of AI in CT analysis and lung nodule detection may significantly reduce the
        cost and workload of radiologist.
