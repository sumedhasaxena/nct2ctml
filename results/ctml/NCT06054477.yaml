- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consents
- 2. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.
- 3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed Recurrent or Metastatic (R/M)
  Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) that is considered incurable by local
  therapies.
- 4. Have provided tissue for claudin-1 (CLDN1), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
  and biomarker analysis in a central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified
  laboratory.

  cancer
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Has progressive disease (PD) within 6 months of completion of curatively
  intended systemic treatment for locoregionally advanced HNSCC (Phase II randomized
  combination part only).
- "Exclude - 2. Has had radiation therapy (or other non-systemic therapy) within 2\
  \ weeks prior to randomization or patient has not fully recovered (i.e., \u2264\
  Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered treatment.\
  \ Palliative radiotherapy to a limited field is allowed."
- Exclude - 3. Severe immune-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of
  prior immune-oncology agent only for Phase I dose escalation monotherapy and combination
  and Phase II monotherapy.
- Exclude - 4. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
  meningitis.
- Exclude - 5. Dermatological conditions requiring active pharmacological treatment
  including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, excessively dry skin or recurrent conjunctivitis,
  scleroderma, vitiligo, or any other active autoimmune dermatological disorder.
- Exclude - 6. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
  abnormality that might confound the results of the clinical study, interfere with
  the patient's participation for the full duration of the clinical study, or is not
  in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating
  investigator.
- Exclude - 7. Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed death (PD)-1, anti-PD-L1
  or anti-PD-L2 (Phase II randomized combination part only).

summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of ALE.C04 monotherapy
  and in combination with pembrolizumab, to characterize pharmacokinetics profile
  of ALE.C04, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for ALE.C04 in combination with pembrolizumab
  and to assess anti-tumor activity of ALE.C04 in combination with pembrolizumab in
  patients with Head and Neck Cancer.
