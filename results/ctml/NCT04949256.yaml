summary: 'The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab
  plus lenvatinib plus chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy
  as first-line intervention in participants with metastatic esophageal carcinoma.


  The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus chemotherapy
  is superior to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with respect to overall survival
  (OS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by
  blinded independent central review (BICR).'
