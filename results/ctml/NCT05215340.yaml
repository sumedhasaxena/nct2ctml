- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- Participants eligible for inclusion in the study must meet all inclusion criteria
  within 28 days of randomization into the study.
- '* Sign and date the Tissue Screening and Main Informed Consent Forms, prior to
  the start of any study-specific qualification procedures.'
- "* Adults \u226518 years or the minimum legal adult age (whichever is greater) at\
  \ the time of informed consent."
- '* Histologically documented non-squamous NSCLC that meets all of the following
  criteria (Note: Subjects with squamous histology were eligible prior to Protocol
  Version 5.0. After Protocol Version 5.0, subjects with squamous histology are not
  eligible. Subjects with mixed histology, including those with a squamous component,
  remain eligible the study even after Protocol Version 5.0):'
- 1. Stage IIIB or IIIC disease and not candidates for surgical resection or definitive
  chemoradiation, or Stage IV NSCLC disease at the time of randomization (based on
  the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition). Participants with early-stage
  NSCLC who have relapsed should be restaged during screening to ensure their eligibility
  for the study.
- 2. Documented negative test results for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
  lymphoma kinase (ALK), and proto-oncogene1 (ROS1) actionable genomic alterations
  (AGAs) based on analysis of tumor tissue. If test results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1
  are not available, subjects are required to undergo testing performed locally for
  these genomic alterations.
- 3. No known AGAs in neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), proto-oncogene
  B-raf (BRAF), rearranged during transfection (RET), mesenchymal-epithelial transition
  factor (MET), or other actionable driver kinases with locally approved therapies.
  (Testing for genomic alterations besides EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 is not required prior
  to randomization). Subjects whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations are eligible for
  the study.
- '* Has provided a formalin-fixed tumor tissue sample for the measurement of trophoblast
  cell surface protein 2 (TROP2) protein expression and for the assessment of other
  exploratory biomarkers.'
- "* Tumor has high programmed death receptor-1 (PD-L1) expression (TPS \u226550%)\
  \ as determined by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay by central\
  \ testing (minimum of 6 slides)."
- '* Has an adequate treatment washout period before Cycle 1 Day 1.'
- '* Measurable disease based on local imaging assessment using RECIST Version 1.1.'
- "* Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550% by either an echocardiogram\
  \ (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 28 days before randomization."
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 at
  screening.'
- '* Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.'
- '* Adequate bone marrow function within 7 days before randomization.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has received prior systemic treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
- 'Exclude - * Has received prior treatment for NSCLC with any of the following, including
  in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting:'
- Exclude - 1. Any agent, including an antibody-drug conjugate, containing a chemotherapeutic
  agent targeting topoisomerase I.
- Exclude - 2. TROP2-targeted therapy.
- Exclude - 3. Any anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-ligand
  2 (L2) agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell
  receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX40, CD137).
- Exclude - 4. Any other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Participants who received adjuvant
  or neoadjuvant therapy OTHER than those listed above, are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant
  therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of advanced/metastatic
  disease.
- Exclude - * Has spinal cord compression or active and untreated central nervous
  system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously
  treated brain metastases and who are asymptomatic may participate provided they
  are radiologically stable.
- Exclude - * Has received prior radiotherapy \< 4 weeks of start of study intervention
  or more than 30 Gy (unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System
  of Units) to the lung within 6 months of Cycle 1 Day 1.
- 'Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy (beyond NSCLC) except for:'
- "Exclude - 1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease\
  \ \u22653 years before the first dose of study treatment and of low potential risk\
  \ for recurrence."
- Exclude - 2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without
  evidence of disease.
- Exclude - 3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.
- "Exclude - 4. Participants with a history of prostate cancer (tumor/node/metastasis\
  \ stage) of Stage \u2264T2cN0M0 without biochemical recurrence or progression and\
  \ who in the opinion of the Investigator are not deemed to require active intervention."
- Exclude - * Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
  including radiation pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis,
  or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.

  resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any
  underlying pulmonary disorder, or any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory
  disorders with pulmonary involvement or prior complete pneumonectomy.
- 'Exclude - * Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:'
- Exclude - 1. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula
  (QTcF) interval \>470 ms regardless of sex (based on the average of the 12-lead
  electrocardiogram determination at screening).
- Exclude - 2. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization.
- Exclude - 3. Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to randomization.
- Exclude - 4. LVEF \<50% by ECHO or MUGA scan within 28 days before randomization.
- Exclude - 5. New York Heart Association Class 2 to 4 congestive heart failure (CHF)
  at screening.
- Exclude - 6. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \>180 mmHg
  or diastolic blood pressure \>110 mmHg) within 28 days before randomization.

  receiving an approved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)
  vaccine, please follow the vaccine label and/or local guidance.
- Exclude - * Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease (has an active autoimmune
  disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years).
