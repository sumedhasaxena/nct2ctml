This will be a randomized controlled, assessor-blind trial conforming to the CONSORT guidelines. A total of 226 cancer survivors aged over 65 who have completed curative treatment and screened as pre-frail or frail will be recruited and randomized into intervention and control groups. It is expected that upon intervention completion, the intervention group will demonstrate greater reversed frailty status, more improvements in physical performance, better psychological well-being, and enhanced HRQoL compared to the control group. Study instruments will be Fried Phenotype Criteria, Edmonton Frail Scale, Short Physical Performance Battery, Geriatric Depression Scale, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire, and a background questionnaire. The intervention comprises of 1-hour qigong group training twice a week for 8 weeks, then 1-hour weekly follow-up group practice for 8 weeks and self-practice.
