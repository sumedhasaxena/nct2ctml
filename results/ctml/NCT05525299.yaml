summary: 'Target Issue:


  Cognitive impairment in older cancer survivors is highly prevalent and the co-existing
  neuro-psychiatric symptoms, particularly depression, would further complicate the
  psychosocial consequence of existential suffering. However, no reminiscence-based
  interventions are specifically developed for older people with cancer have been
  developed and evaluated.


  Target Population:


  Cancer survivors aged 65 years old and above with a mild cognitive impairment identified
  by the HK-MoCA 5-Min Protocol cognitive assessment.


  Intervention:


  This research project aims to implement a brief reminiscence-based intervention
  that includes six reminiscence chatting sessions among older cancer survivors. The
  proposed reminiscence-based intervention has great potential to provide psychological
  and spiritual care as well as comfort to those who are weak, aged and are in need
  of assistance.


  Study Objectives:


  1. To evaluate the effect of a reminiscence-based life review intervention on copying
  with existential suffering including meaning of life (primary outcome), cognitive
  function, psychological distress and social support (secondary outcomes) in older
  cancer survivors

  2. To explore older cancer survivors'' experience of the intervention regarding
  the impact of the intervention on their existential suffering


  Study Method:


  The investigator will recruit 116 voluntary elder patients from the outpatient oncology
  clinics of the Queen Mary Hospital to participate in the study. They will be individually
  randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive usual care or the brief reminiscence-based
  intervention at home. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention
  (T1), and 6-week follow-up (T2). A qualitative interview regarding the feedback
  on the intervention will be undertaken only in the intervention group.'
