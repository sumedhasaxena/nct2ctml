It is the 3rd most common cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. The five-year survival rates of liver cancer differ greatly with disease staging, ranging from 91.5% in early-stage to 11% in late-stage. The early and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer is paramount in improving cancer survival. Liver cancer is diagnosed radiologically via cross sectional imaging, e.g. computed tomography (CT), without the routine use of liver biopsy. However, with current internationally-recommended radiological reporting methods, up to 49% of liver lesions may be inconclusive, resulting in repeated scans and a delay in diagnosis and treatment. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that that can accurately diagnosed liver cancer has been developed. Based on an interim analysis, the algorithm achieved a high diagnostic accuracy. The AI algorithm is now ready for implementation.\n\nThis study aims to prospective validate this AI algorithm in comparison with the current standard of radiological reporting in a randomized manner in the at-risk population undergoing triphasic contrast CT. This research project is totally independent and separated from the actual clinical reporting of the CT scan by the duty radiologist. The primary study outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of liver cancer, which will be unbiasedly based on a composite clinical reference standard.", "treatment_list": {"step": [{"arm": [{"arm_code": "Prototype AI algorithm", "arm_internal_id": 0, "arm_description": "In-house prototype deep learning artificial intelligence algorithm", "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Diagnostic Test: Prototype artificial intelligence algorithm", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}, {"arm_code": "LI_RADS interpretation", "arm_internal_id": 1, "arm_description": "LI-RADS criteria will be assessed independently by two specified abdominal radiologists with at least 10 years of experience in cross-sectional abdominal imaging", "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Diagnostic Test: LI-RADS", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}], "match": [{"and": [{"clinical": {"oncotree_primary_diagnosis": "", "disease_status": ["", ""]}}, {"genomic": {"hugo_symbol": "", "variant_category": ""}}]}]}]}}
