summary: 'Radiofrequency ablation has been used for treatment of solid neoplasms of
  the liver, lung, kidney and adrenal. Recently, EUS-guided RFA has become available
  and the device allows EUS-guided treatment of pancreatic neoplasms. The procedure
  has been shown to be feasible in the porcine pancreas and was used to treat small
  groups of patients that are not suitable for surgery suffering from pancreatic neoplasms.


  The aim of the current study is to perform a multi-center prospective study on EUS-guided
  radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of solid pancreatic neoplasms. The hypothesis is that
  EUS-guided RFA is safe, feasible and effective for treating solid pancreatic neoplasms.'
