summary: 'The study aims to compare the efficacy of different pelvic floor muscle
  training (PFMT) modes on improving urinary incontinence (UI) recovery in prostate
  cancer (PCa) patients after radical prostatectomy (RP). The methods being compared
  include standard PFMT (S-PFMT) , a somatosensory interactive PFMT (SI-PFMT, an enhanced
  PFMT) , and a standard PFMT combined with pelvic floor muscle magnetic stimulation
  (S-PFMT+MS). Eligible participants are randomized into either of the groups to receive
  different modalities of post-operative PFMT.


  Subjects in the S-PFMT group received traditional verbal instructions and paper-based
  educational materials. For the SI-PFMT group, an interactive experiential education
  model was adopted. First, an educational video introduced the importance and basic
  information of postoperative PFMT. Then, synchronized PFMT guidance through a combination
  of audio and video would be used. Subjects assigned to the S-PFMT+MS group, on the
  basis of traditional verbal and paper-based education, pelvic floor magnetic stimulation
  therapy was applied using a pelvic floor magnetic stimulator, operated by the same
  experienced rehabilitation physician.


  Self administered questionnaires and 1-hour pad test would be used to assess the
  treatment outcomes at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.'
