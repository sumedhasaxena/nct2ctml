Patients with maxillary or mandibular neoplastic, inflammatory and congenital diseases who require immediate or secondary reconstructive surgery will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nStudy instruments: 3D-printed patient-specific titanium surgical plates and conventional plates.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint is the accuracy of reconstruction. The secondary endpoints include the accuracy of osteotomy, reconstruction time, total operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of post-operative hospital stay, and postoperative adverse events.\n\nData analysis: The accuracy parameters, reconstruction time, total operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of post-operative hospital stay will be presented as mean values with standard deviations. The post-operative adverse events will be calculated and presented as frequency with standard deviation.\n\nExpected results: This randomised control trial will prove improved accuracy and efficiency of reconstruction using 3D printed patient-specific titanium surgical plates. This study is expected to provide high-level evidence to push forward the popularity of using 3D medical printing technology in surgical field.", "treatment_list": {"step": [{"arm": [{"arm_code": "3D-printed patient-specific plate group", "arm_internal_id": 0, "arm_description": "3D-printed patient-specific plate will be used for reconstruction in this patient group", "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Device: 3D-printed patient-specific plate", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}, {"arm_code": "Conventional plate group", "arm_internal_id": 1, "arm_description": "conventional commercial plates will be used for reconstruction in this patient group", "arm_suspended": "N", "dose_level": [{"level_code": "0", "level_description": "Device: Conventional commercial reconstruction plate", "level_internal_id": 0, "level_suspended": "N"}]}], "match": [{"and": [{"clinical": {"oncotree_primary_diagnosis": "", "disease_status": ["", ""]}}, {"genomic": {"hugo_symbol": "", "variant_category": ""}}]}]}]}}
