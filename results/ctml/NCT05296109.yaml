summary: Parotid neoplasm consists of a wide range of benign and malignant lesions,
  and parotidectomy has been the mainstay for management of these neoplasms. Within
  the parotid gland there are branches of the intra-parotid facial nerves, which are
  tiny in calibre and are prone to injury to injury during operation. It has been
  reported in recent retrospective view that the incidence of temporary and permanent
  facial nerve injury were 9.2% and 5.2% respectively, the risk of which increased
  with old age, malignant tumour and revision surgery. Traditional the incidental
  of facial nerve injury is reduced by intra-operative facial nerve monitoring and
  surgical magnification, while imaging has limited role in aiding this purpose. However
  with advancement in MRI technique high resolution three-dimensional sequences (i.e.
  neurogram sequences) are available for better visualization of branches of facial
  nerves. The investigators would therefore aim to demonstrate additional efficacy
  of these techniques and also to compare with conventional 3D post-contrast anatomical
  imaging studies in the localization and visualization of the facial nerve branches
  in patients with tumour. With better pre-operative imaging, the investigators hope
  to reduce the chance of facial nerve injury in these patients.
