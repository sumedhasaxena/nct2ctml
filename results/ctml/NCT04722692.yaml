- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- A. Preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, of any grade and any size if planned for mastectomy.
- B. Planned Risk-reducing mastectomy, if it would be considered for upfront SLND
  due to institutional practice or in case of an individualised recommendation.
- 'C. Any case with a preoperative diagnosis of pre-invasive or unclear lesion, that
  upfront SLND would be otherwise considered, such as, but not limited to:'
- '* Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS grade 3 any size or, DCIS grade
  2 larger than or equal to 20 mm on mammography and planned for breast conserving
  surgery or'
- '* Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS on core biopsy with a palpable
  mass on clinical examination or mass effect on radiology or'
- '* Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS with suspicion of micro-invasion
  on core biopsy or'
- '* Patients with a mammographic/ultrasound/MRI finding, suspicious for breast cancer
  (BIRADS 4 or 5) planned for diagnostic excision with breast conserving surgery,
  with no definitive diagnosis of invasive cancer or'
- '* Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, any grade, any size and planned
  for a complex oncoplastic procedure or'
- '* Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, any grade, any size and planned
  for a procedure that may compromise detection rate for a future SLND, such as, but
  not confined to: lesions in the upper outer quadrant or the axillary tail, removal
  of the nipple areola complex and so on or'
- '* The above mentioned categories with a preoperative diagnosis of pleomorphic Lobular
  Cancer in Situ (pLCIS), classic Lobular Neoplasia (LN) or Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia
  (ADH).'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Intolerance/hypersensitivity to iron, dextran compounds or SPIO
- Exclude - * An iron overload disease
- Exclude - * Patient deprived of liberty or under guardianship

summary: The trial aims to investigate the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)
  nanoparticles as a tracer for delayed sentinel lymph node dissection (d-SLND) in
  patients where upfront axillary surgery (SLND) is oncologically deemed unnecessary
  and should be avoided. This includes but is not limited to patients with a preoperative
  diagnosis of ductal cancer in situ of the breast (DCIS), an unclear BIRADS 4-5 planned
  for diagnostic excision or women planned for risk reducing mastectomy. SPIO is injected
  in the primary operation, and should final specimen pathology demonstrate invasive
  breast cancer, only then is an operation in the axilla (d-SLND) performed.
