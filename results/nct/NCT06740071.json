The methods being compared include standard PFMT (S-PFMT) , a somatosensory interactive PFMT (SI-PFMT, an enhanced PFMT) , and a standard PFMT combined with pelvic floor muscle magnetic stimulation (S-PFMT+MS). Eligible participants are randomized into either of the groups to receive different modalities of post-operative PFMT.\n\nSubjects in the S-PFMT group received traditional verbal instructions and paper-based educational materials. For the SI-PFMT group, an interactive experiential education model was adopted. First, an educational video introduced the importance and basic information of postoperative PFMT. Then, synchronized PFMT guidance through a combination of audio and video would be used. Subjects assigned to the S-PFMT+MS group, on the basis of traditional verbal and paper-based education, pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy was applied using a pelvic floor magnetic stimulator, operated by the same experienced rehabilitation physician.\n\nSelf administered questionnaires and 1-hour pad test would be used to assess the treatment outcomes at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Prostate Cancer (Post Prostatectomy)"], "keywords": ["pelvic floor muscle training", "post operative urinary incontinence"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 100, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "standard pelvic floor muscle training group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training", "Procedure: pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy", "Behavioral: standard pelvic floor muscle training"]}, {"label": "somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training"]}, {"label": "standard pelvic floor muscle training combined with pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training", "description": "synchronized PFMT guidance through a combination of audio and video", "armGroupLabels": ["somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training group", "standard pelvic floor muscle training group"]}, {"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy", "description": "stimulation frequency was set at 10 Hz, with stimulation administered in cycles of 5 seconds on followed by 5 seconds off.
