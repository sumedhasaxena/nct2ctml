Substudy-01 will compare the different novel combinations versus standard of care in participants with metastatic (cancer that has spread) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not been treated before. Substudy-02 will compare the different novel combination versus standard of care in participants with cancer that has progressed after receiving previous treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Substudy-03 will compare the different novel combinations versus standard of care in participants with resectable stage II-III NSCLC.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\nSubstudy-01 and Substudy-02: To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).\n\nSubstudy-03: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment combinations based on complete pathological response (pCR) rate."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Lung Cancer", "Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer", "Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 593, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Substudy 01: Zimberelimab (ZIM) + Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) + Domvanalimab (DOM)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive ZIM, SG and DOM until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Domvanalimab (DOM)", "Drug: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG)"]}, {"label": "Substudy 01: ZIM + DOM + Etrumadenant (ETRUMA)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive ZIM, DOM and ETRUMA until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Domvanalimab (DOM)", "Drug: Etrumadenant (ETRUMA)"]}, {"label": "Substudy 01: ZIM + ETRUMA", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive ZIM and ETRUMA until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Etrumadenant (ETRUMA)"]}, {"label": "Substudy 01: Zimberelimab (ZIM) + Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive ZIM and SG until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG)"]}, {"label": "Substudy 01: ZIM + Platinum Based Chemotherapy", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Expansion Stage Only: Participants will receive ZIM plus any one of the chemotherapy (choice of chemotherapy is dependent on histology).\n\nPlatinum Based Chemotherapy will be cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed (non-squamous histology) or carboplatin, paclitaxel and nabpaclitaxel (squamous histology).", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Carboplatin", "Drug: Cisplatin", "Drug: Pemetrexed", "Drug: Paclitaxel", "Drug: Nab-paclitaxel"]}, {"label": "Substudy 02: SG + ZIM + ETRUMA", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive SG, ZIM and ETRUMA until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Zimberelimab (ZIM)", "Drug: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG)", "Drug: Etrumadenant (ETRUMA)"]}, {"label": "Substudy 02: Either Docetaxel or SG (Monotherapy Only)", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Participants will receive either Docetaxel or SG until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or protocol specified discontinuation criteria are met.", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG)", "Drug: Docetaxel"]}, {"label": "Substudy 03 -
