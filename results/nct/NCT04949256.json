In Part 1 (FP and TP Safety Run-in), participants will be treated with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus FP or TP. Dose-limiting toxicities, safety, and tolerability will be assessed.\n\nIn Part 2 (Main Study), participants (not including those participating in Part 1) will be treated with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus chemotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability will be assessed."
