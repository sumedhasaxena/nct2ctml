Note: Patients with such features should be assessed by the surgical team regarding stomal bypass prior to study enrolment. Such patients can still be considered for study enrolment after undergoing stomal bypass.\n* Known hypersensitivity reaction to the study drugs (i.e. fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin)\n* Known peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or more in severity.\\\\ -Patients who have received an experimental anticancer therapy within the last 28 days.\n* Previous pelvic radiotherapy\n* Previous oxaliplatin or irinotecan for the treatment of colon or rectal cancer.\n* Patient with hip prosthesis\n* Major surgery (i.e. requiring general anaesthetics) within the last 28 days. Exception: Any patient who underwent stomal bypass for obstructing primary tumour within the last 14 days are still eligible, as long as the patient has sufficiently recovered from the surgery at the investigator's discretion.\n* Known cardiac disease that is symptomatic or poorly controlled, including cardiac failure, arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease.\n* Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the last 12 months.\n* Intercurrent infections or medical illnesses that are serious/ potentially life-threatening and require ongoing treatment.\n* Patients who are unable to take capecitabine tablets uncrushed by the oral route (e.g. enteral feeding).

The obstruction should be treated with ureteric stent(s) or percutaneous nephrostomy(s) prior to study enrolment.
