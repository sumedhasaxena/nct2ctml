            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests the addition of BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to the usual immunotherapy after initial treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Relatlimab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The usual approach of treatment is initial treatment with chemotherapy such as the combination of cisplatin (or carboplatin) and gemcitabine, along with immunotherapy such as nivolumab. After the initial treatment is finished, patients may continue to receive additional immunotherapy. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. Giving BMS-986016 in addition to the usual immunotherapy after initial treatment may extend the time without the tumor cells growing or spreading longer than the usual approach in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance therapy shows a signal of improved progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in patients who do not progress following treatment with platinum-gemcitabine-nivolumab combination in the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (R/M NPC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance improves overall survival (OS) compared to nivolumab maintenance alone.\n\nII. To compare patterns of failure (local-regional relapse and distant metastasis) between treatment arms.\n\nIII. To determine if adding BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to nivolumab maintenance improves objective response, duration of response, and disease control rate compared to nivolumab maintenance alone.\n\nIV. To evaluate the tolerability of nivolumab-BMS-986016 (relatlimab) maintenance and assess and compare toxicity between arms based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) criteria.\n\nV. To evaluate baseline plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (\\< 2000 copies/mL versus \\[vs.\\] \\>= 2000 copies/mL) as a prognostic biomarker.\n\nVI. To validate post-induction plasma EBV DNA (detectable \\[\\>= 1 copies/mL\\] vs. undetectable \\[0 copies/mL\\]) as a prognostic biomarker.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect blood and tissue specimens for future translational science studies.\n\nII. To assess post-induction plasma EBV DNA (detectable \\[\\>= 1 copies/mL\\] vs. undetectable \\[0 copies/mL\\]) as a predictive biomarker.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, cisplatin IV or carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who do not progress radiologically are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo CT or MRI on study. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or bone scan as clinically indicated.\n\nARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and relatlimab IV over 30-90 minutes. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo CT or MRI on study. Patients also undergo PET/CT or bone scan as clinically indicated.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months in years 3-5, and then annually."

Cisplatin or carboplatin may be used at the discretion of the investigator - except for patients with CrCl between 30-50 mL/min, for whom carboplatin should be used instead of cisplatin. CrCl must be \\> 50 mL/min for cisplatin to be used.\n* Albumin-adjusted calcium level based on corrected calcium equation =\\< 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (patients are allowed to have treatment for hypercalcemia prior to starting treatment).\n* No prior systemic treatment for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) NPC including cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prior treatment for non-recurrent and non-metastatic NPC is allowed.\n* No prior treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor (except if given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for NPC), PD-L1 inhibitor, anti-PD-L2 inhibitor, LAG-3 inhibitor, CTLA-4 inhibitor (except if given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for non-recurrent and non-metastatic NPC), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways.\n* The interval between the last dose of curative-intent treatment for non-recurrent, non-metastatic NPC, including definitive radiotherapy (RT) and/or induction, concurrent, or adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence must be \u02c3 6 months.\n* Clinically significant toxicities from any prior systemic therapy or radiotherapy must have resolved to grade 0 or 1 as per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v 5.0 - except alopecia, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dysphagia, and fatigue. Patients with a history of grade 3-4 cisplatin related neuropathy must have recovered to grade 0-2 prior to registration. Patients with a history of hearing impairment, or ototoxicity from prior cisplatin, of any grade are allowed.\n* No prior palliative RT within 30 days prior to registration.

The irradiated sites must not be the only sites of measurable recurrent disease.\n* No major surgical procedures within 30 days prior to registration.\n* No history of unstable angina requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months.\n* No history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.\n* New York Heart Association Functional Classification II or better (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] Functional Classification III/IV are not eligible). Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or a known history of having a left ventricular ejection fraction \\< 50% must be stably controlled with medication in the opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate.\n* No prior history of myocarditis.\n* No active infection requiring IV antibiotics, IV antiviral, or IV antifungal treatments at the time of study registration.\n* No history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis requiring steroids and/or immunosuppressive therapy, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, drug-induced pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans), or idiopathic pneumonitis.\n* No history of multi-drug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) or active TB, as defined by systemic treatment received =\\< 2 years prior to registration. Note: Patients who had a history of treated TB \u02c3 2 years prior to registration are allowed.\n* No prior solid organ transplant or bone marrow transplant.\n* No conditions requiring systemic treatment with either immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of registration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Steroid premedication for the prophylaxis of CT contrast-related allergies is allowed. The use of dexamethasone as an anti-emetic premedication prior to chemotherapy is also allowed.\n* No active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment (i.e., disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs) within the past 2 years.
