While literature shows some evidence of improvement in PA following technology-based PA promotion interventions among cancer survivors, high-quality randomised control trials (RCTs), with objective measures of PA and longer-term follow-up, are lacking. Using a theoretical framework that addresses action control in addition to intention formation may enhance intervention effect. The Multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework is an extension of the traditional intention-formation theories, incorporating constructs that address the translation of intention into behaviour and continual action control. After comprehensively searching, no previous or ongoing RCTs have investigated the efficacy of a technology-based PA promotion intervention in cancer survivors that is designed based on the M-PAC framework. Investigators therefore propose a RCT to evaluate a technology-based intervention (WExercise) to support the promotion of PA in cancer survivors.", "detailedDescription": "Objective: To develop a technology-based physical activity promotion intervention (WExercise) for cancer survivors based on the Multi-process Action Control (M-PAC) Framework and examine its usability and efficacy.\n\nMain hypothesis: The WExercise group will have a significantly greater increase in aerobic exercise than the self-directed exercise group at post-intervention.\n\nDesign: Phase 1- Application development; Phase 2- Usability testing (n=10); Phase 3- Assessor-blind two-arm randomized controlled trial (n=98; WExercise or self-directed exercise group).\n\nSubjects: Physically inactive cancer survivors who have completed curative treatment.\n\nStudy instruments: Accelerometry, Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, EORTC QLQ-C30, M-PAC questionniare; administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention.\n\nInterventions: Both groups will receive written physical activity guidelines with a goal to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. The WExercise group will additionally receive 10 weekly automated online classes delivered on a mobile application which aim at developing participants' reflective, regulatory, and reflexive processes based on the M-PAC to achieve recommended physical activity levels (1st-3rd week: intention formation; 4th-8th weeks: behavioral regulations; 9th-10th weeks: action control maintenance).\n\nMain outcomes: Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise (primary), exercise capacity, and quality of life.\n\nData analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. Application usage in the WExercise group will be presented in descriptive statistics. Generalized linear mixed-effect models will be used to assess between-group and within-group differences in the outcomes.\n\nExpected results: The findings will inform the design of future eHealth interventions to encourage and sustain health behavior change in cancer survivors."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cancer", "Survivorship"], "keywords": ["cancer survivor", "physical activity", "website"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "A two-arm, assessor-blinded RCT", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 98, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention condition (WExercise)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive a written information sheet (i.e., PA guide, safety precautions, and goal) same as the control group.
