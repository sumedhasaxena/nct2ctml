Participants with solid tumors will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype, will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified, will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever occurs first."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Solid Tumors"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 920, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Cohort A: ROS1 Fusion-positive tumors (excluding NSCLC)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants with metastatic or advanced solid tumors, with the exception of NSCLC will receive entrectinib once daily in repeated 28-day cycles at a dose of 600 milligram per day (mg/day) for adults and pediatric participants with a body surface area (BSA) \\>/= 1.51 squaremeter (m2).
