This study will be divided into 2 parts: Dose Confirmation (Part 1) and Efficacy Expansion (Part 2) and will enroll participants who are at least 18 years of age with rrDLBCL. The hypotheses are: ZV in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is superior to R-GemOx with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per Lugano response criteria by blinded independent review committee (BICR); and that ZV in combination with bendamustine rituximab (BR) is superior to BR with respect to PFS per Lugano response criteria by BICR.\n\nWith protocol amendment 4 (effective: 04-April-2024), enrollment in Cohort B (study arms Bendamustine Rituximab \\[BR\\] and ZV + BR) is discontinued. No efficacy outcome analysis and hypothesis testing will be conducted for Cohort B."
