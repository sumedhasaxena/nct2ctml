Subjects who are receiving oral anticoagulants at the time of screening must be transitioned to LMWH prior to randomization. Subjects who require treatment with platelet inhibitors are not eligible.\n* Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Prior laparoscopic nephrectomy within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Minor surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) within 10 days before randomization. Complete wound healing from major or minor surgery must have occurred at least prior to randomization.\n\n  * Note: Fresh tumor biopsies should be performed at least 7 days before randomization. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgical procedures, including biopsies, are not eligible.\n* Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) \\> 480 ms per electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before randomization.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days before randomization.\n\n  * Note: If feasible, approved non-live vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 should be administered at least 2 weeks before randomization.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"centralContacts": [{"name": "Exelixis Clinical Trials", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "1-888-EXELIXIS (888-393-5494)", "email": "druginfo@exelixis.com"}, {"name": "Backup or International", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "650-837-7400"}]}}, "hasResults": false}
