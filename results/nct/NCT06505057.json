We hope we can develop this service in our locality to allow more young female cancer patients to have their fertility preserved.", "detailedDescription": "To date, transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue has resulted in births of at least 130 children but data on transplantation of ovarian tissue removed before puberty are scarce.\n\nDuring ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC), it is possible to freeze isolated oocytes. In 2003, Revel et al described for the first time oocyte isolation in children younger than 12 years with seven, eight and seven oocytes isolated from the ovarian cortex of patients aged 5, 8 and 10 years, respectively.\n\nAt this moment, financial constraint is another great hindrance to fertility preservation in Hong Kong as the procedure is not cheap. Cryopreservation of gametes and embryos involving assisted reproductive technology is expensive and the costs of fertility preservation impose a great burden to these cancer patients on top of the great expenses for their chemo- or radiotherapy. It is almost impossible for underprivileged families.\n\nYoung cancer patients may often need immediate gonadotoxic treatment for their cancer, just like those with haematological cancers. In these patients, egg or embryo freezing is not possible as it takes at least 8-12 days' time for ovarian stimulation. Ovarian tissue freezing is an ideal option for these patients as it can be performed immediately and does not need any time for ovarian stimulation. We hope we can develop this service in our locality to allow more young female cancer patients to have their fertility preserved."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Neoplasms"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 100, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ovarian tissue freezing and subsequent auto-transplantation after thawing", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Removal of the ovarian tissue will be retrieved via laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.
