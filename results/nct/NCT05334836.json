In patients with pre-malignant mucinous PCN (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)), pancreatic cancer can originate from the pre-malignant PCN, or develop in other parts of the pancreas uninvolved by the original PCN due to \"field-defect\". While the malignant potentials of different PCNs vary, the frequency of invasive carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia in IPMN remains substantial, ranging from 36-100% in the main duct type (MD-IPMN) and from 14-48% in the branch duct type (BD-IPMN).\n\nMultiple consensus guidelines and society guidelines have been developed based on cyst structural characteristics and cyst related symptoms to guide management between surgical resection or surveillance of pre-malignant PCN. The 2017 revised international consensus guidelines (Fukuoka guidelines) recommend surgical resection for all MD-IPMN and BD-IPMN with high-risk stigmata of malignancy or worrisome features confirmed by EUS (definite mural nodule \\> 5mm, main pancreatic duct involvement (dilation / abrupt change in calibre), cytology suspicious or positive for malignancy on EUS guided fine needle aspiration). On the other hand, surveillance of asymptomatic BD-IPMN without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features would be performed with cross-sectional imaging and/or EUS periodically, with intervals tailored to the size of the BD-IPMN.\n\nAlthough the consensus guidelines and society guidelines have been widely applied in clinical practice, considerable variations in their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in predicting advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia and invasive cancer) in pre-malignant PCN were reported in validation studies. As such, false-positive (recommending patients with low-risk PCN for a major surgery with considerable risks of morbidity/ mortality) or false-negative (missing a high-risk PCN with indication for surgery to prevent cancer development) prediction of malignant progression of mucinous PCN can still occur with significant clinical ramification. In addition, while cyst structural characteristics are traditional risk factors for neoplastic progression of PCN, these are not easily modifiable unless invasive procedures such as surgical resection or cyst ablation is performed. Therefore, it is of clinical importance to identify novel risk factors in pancreas that are potentially modifiable and may improve the current risk stratification algorithm for detection of high-risk lesions.\n\nPancreatic steatosis is an increasingly recognized important metabolic condition with a prevalence of 16% to 35% in Asian populations. Recent retrospective studies have suggested an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, IPMN and progression of BD-IPMN in patients with pancreatic steatosis. However, despite its potential role as a modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer and progression of pre-malignant PCN such as IPMN, the actual prevalence of pancreatic steatosis in patients with PCN is not known.\n\nWhile ultrasound, CT and MRI have been used for fat quantitation in organs, MRI is best suited for this purpose since its signal is dependent on fat content. In contrast to fat content assessment by ultrasound in which interobserver variability may undermine its reliability, the fat fraction measurements by MRI are reproducible and accurate, and have been validated against histology in animal models. In addition, MRI also has an advantage over CT since there is no risk of radiation exposure.\n\nPrevious work by our group has defined the normal range of fat content in pancreas (1.8% -10.4%) in the healthy Hong Kong population using MRI for fat quantification. The prevalence of fatty pancreas in healthy volunteers was found to be 16.1% when a pancreatic fat upper limit of normal of 10.4% was adopted. Our group has also shown that patients with fatty liver do not always have fatty pancreas. Among the 195 patients with fatty liver in our prior study, 82/195 (42.1%) had both fatty liver and fatty pancreas and 113/195 (57.9%) had fatty liver alone. Such observation suggested that pancreatic steatosis is likely a separate metabolic condition that deserves further investigation for its potential impact on important pancreatic pathologies such as pre-malignant PCN (eg, IPMN) and pancreatic cancer.\n\nBecause little is known about the prevalence of pancreatic steatosis in patients with PCN, we would like to propose a prospective, matched case-control study to determine the prevalence of pancreatic steatosis using MRI in patients with presumed IPMN or MCN and compare with that of age and sex matched healthy subjects in the general population."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Pancreatic Steatosis", "Pancreatic Cyst"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 236, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Pancreatic cystic lesion subjects", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Patients with at least 1 pancreatic cystic lesion presumed to be IPMN or MCN based on CT, MRI or EUS features, with a cyst size \u2265 5mm", "interventionNames": ["Diagnostic Test: MRI for pancreatic fat and liver fat quantitation"]}, {"label": "Healthy subjects", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Healthy subjects", "interventionNames": ["Diagnostic Test: MRI for pancreatic fat and liver fat quantitation"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIAGNOSTIC_TEST", "name": "MRI for pancreatic fat and liver fat quantitation", "description": "MR imaging would be performed using a 3.0 T scanner (Achieva X series, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a 16-channel SENSE-XL-Torso array coil. 3D spoiled chemical-shift water-fat mDixon sequence (TR = 5.7 ms, first TE/echo spacing = 1.2-1.4 (ms)/1.0-1.2 (ms), number of echoes = 6, flip angle = 3\u00b0, SENSE acceleration = 2, a breath hold technique would be employed to acquire co-registered water, fat, fat-fraction and T2\\* image series and would be reconstructed with slice thickness/number of slices = 3.0 mm/50.
