However, prostatectomy and radiotherapy carry certain degree of morbidity, including the risks of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and injury to the structures in the proximity. Active surveillance carries the risk of disease progression and psychological distress to the patients. Focal therapy employs the concept of only destroying the significant lesion, resulting in disease cure and improved functional outcome. Among the different options of focal therapy, cryotherapy is one of the most commonly employed energy sources. It exerts its effect through freezing of tissue and vascular injury, leading to destruction of cancer tissue. Our study aims at assess the safety and effectiveness of such treatment in prostate cancer management"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Prostate Cancer"], "keywords": ["Prostate cancer", "Focal therapy", "Cryotherapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Cryotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Cryotherapy achieves a temperature averaging -40\u00b0C.
