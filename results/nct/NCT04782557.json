The aim of the current study is thus to examine the concentration of ctDNA in portal vein (EUS-guided PVA), hepatic vein (EUS-guided HVA) and peripheral blood to understand the first pass effect of the liver with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and the possibility of using ctDNA as a marker for preoperative staging, restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and monitoring for recurrence.", "detailedDescription": "The discovery of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (crDNA) in blood and the maturation of technologies for ctDNA analysis have presented an attractive opportunity for minimally invasive \"liquid biopsy\" genomic diagnostics.
