After Protocol Version 5.0, subjects with squamous histology are not eligible. Subjects with mixed histology, including those with a squamous component, remain eligible the study even after Protocol Version 5.0):\n\n  1. Stage IIIB or IIIC disease and not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or Stage IV NSCLC disease at the time of randomization (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition).

(Testing for genomic alterations besides EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 is not required prior to randomization). Subjects whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations are eligible for the study.\n* Has provided a formalin-fixed tumor tissue sample for the measurement of trophoblast cell surface protein 2 (TROP2) protein expression and for the assessment of other exploratory biomarkers.\n* Tumor has high programmed death receptor-1 (PD-L1) expression (TPS \u226550%) as determined by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay by central testing (minimum of 6 slides).\n* Has an adequate treatment washout period before Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Measurable disease based on local imaging assessment using RECIST Version 1.1.\n* Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550% by either an echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 28 days before randomization.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 at screening.\n* Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n* Adequate bone marrow function within 7 days before randomization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has received prior systemic treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC.\n* Has received prior treatment for NSCLC with any of the following, including in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting:\n\n  1. Any agent, including an antibody-drug conjugate, containing a chemotherapeutic agent targeting topoisomerase I.\n  2. TROP2-targeted therapy.\n  3. Any anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-ligand 2 (L2) agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX40, CD137).\n  4. Any other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy OTHER than those listed above, are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of advanced/metastatic disease.\n* Has spinal cord compression or active and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

For any participant receiving an approved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccine, please follow the vaccine label and/or local guidance.\n* Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease (has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years).\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosage \\>10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy \u22647 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that is not well controlled.\n* Has an active hepatitis or uncontrolled hepatitis B or active hepatitis C infection.\n* Has an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals.\n* Had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to either the drug or inactive ingredients (including but not limited to polysorbate 80) of Dato-DXd or pembrolizumab.",
