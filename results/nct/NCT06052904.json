Music therapy, for example, music breathing therapy, has been increasingly used as a nonpharmacological care strategy in the healthcare field. Music breathing therapy is an adaptation of the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music. It has demonstrated promising potential for enhancing resilience and alleviating psychological distress among diverse populations, including women with complex post-traumatic stress disorder, individuals with work-related stress and caregivers of dementia patients. However, it is unclear whether this is a feasible and acceptable approach to enhance resilience, reduce psychological distress, and improve the quality of life of Chinese caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAims:\n\n* To assess the effects of a mobile health-delivered music breathing therapy in enhancing resilience, reducing psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and caregiver strain, and improving coping and quality of life of parental caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer\n* To determine the feasibility (in terms of recruitment rates, dropout rates, engagement rates, randomization process, and intervention delivery mode), and acceptability of the intervention.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nIt is hypothesized that compared with caregivers who receive usual care, those who receive the mHealth-delivered music breathing therapy will report higher levels of resilience (primary outcome), lower levels of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and caregiver strain, better coping and quality of life at the 2-month (immediately after intervention) and 6-month follow-ups."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Oncology", "Psychological Distress"], "keywords": ["Music breathing", "Cancer", "Caregivers", "Children", "Psychological distress", "Resilience"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 60, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Home-based music breathing therapy comprising eight 1-hour weekly sessions for 2 months delivered through Zoom, an online video conferencing platform, by a qualified music therapist.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: mHealth-delivered music breathing therapy"]}, {"label": "Control group", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Eight weekly online educational modules on medical information and advice about caring for a child who has been newly diagnosed with cancer via email for 2 months.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Online educational modules"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "mHealth-delivered music breathing therapy", "description": "Parental caregivers in the intervention group will receive individual home-based music breathing therapy comprising eight 1-hour weekly sessions for 2 months delivered through Zoom, by a qualified music therapist based on a standardized and validated music breathing instruction manual.
