It must be managed aggressively and strong opioids are recommended as the mainstay of treatment. However, patients develop opioid-related adverse effects. EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) and celiac ganglion neurolysis (CGN) has been shown to provide high efficacy for pain control. The optimal timing, however, is in debate."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable", "Tumor Pancreas", "Pain Cancer"], "keywords": ["Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable", "tumor pain", "endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac ganglion neurolysis"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Patient will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the upfront EUS-guided CGN/CPN approach or to the conventional step-up approach at the time of EUS.

The coeliac ganglia are often seen to the left of the coeliac artery, between the aorta and the left adrenal gland, at the level between the coeliac artery and the left adrenal artery. They are also visualized cephalad to the coeliac artery in some cases. Hypoechoic nodular structures linked by hypoechoic threads residing in the periphery of this region were defined as the coeliac ganglia . A 19G or 22G needle was used for puncture of the CGN.
