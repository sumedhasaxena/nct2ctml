Despite so, recurrence risk of NSCLC after surgical resection remains high. Sacituzumab govitecan, a novel antibody drug conjugate, was demonstrated to be clinically active in metastatic NSCLC. This study aims to study the clinical efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan plus immunotherapy in resectable NSCLC. This is a open-label, single arm, multicentre, phase II study. Patients with EGFR/ALK negative, stage II-III (AJCC 8th edition), resectable NSCLC are eligible and will receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus sacituzumab govitecan, followed by surgical resection of tumour, and then 13 cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Lung Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 37, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Sacituzumab Govitecan and Pembrolizumab", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "* Neoadjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab and sacituzumab govitecan is given for a total for 4 cycles.
