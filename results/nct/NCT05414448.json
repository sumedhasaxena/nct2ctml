As a result, a significant proportion of interval CRC was attributed to the missed lesions during index colonoscopy. Risk factors of missed lesions included proximal location, serrate or flat morphology, poor bowel preparation, short withdrawal time and endoscopist experience.\n\nTo overcome this pitfall, various methods were developed to improve adenoma detection rate (ADR), including distal attachment devices. Among the mucosal exposure devices, Endocuff Vision\u00ae was shown to be superior than conventional colonoscopies.\n\nRecently, artificial intelligence and automatic computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) systems have developed rapidly and revolutionized the medical field. Nevertheless, there was a potential limitation of 'blind spot' if the endoscopist failed to expose the colonic mucosa adequately leading to missed lesions. To date, no available data or ongoing clinical trial was reported regarding the combined use of CADe and mucosal exposure devices. It may enhance the performance of CADe and provide a novel definitive solution to this unaddressed yet important clinical problem.\n\nIn this prospective parallel randomized controlled trial, we aim to evaluate the impact of combined use of a new CADe system (ENDOAID) and mucosal exposure device (Endocuff Vision\u00ae) on colorectal neoplasia detection."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Adenoma", "Colorectal Cancer", "Colorectal Neoplasms"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1726, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ENDOAID", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "CADe system will be used during withdrawal phase of colonoscopy."}, {"label": "ENDOAID with ENDOCUFF", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "CADe system and mucosal exposure device (ENDOCUFF) will be used during withdrawal phase of colonoscopy.", "interventionNames": ["Device: ENDOCUFF"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "ENDOCUFF", "description": "ENDOCUFF mucousal exposure device will be used during withdrawal process of the colonoscopy.", "armGroupLabels": ["ENDOAID with ENDOCUFF"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
