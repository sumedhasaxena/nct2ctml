Mice were treated with 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CYP) once monthly, for 4 months. The CYP-treated mice were then treated with B. longum HK003 for 14 days. Results showed that B. longum treatment significantly enhanced skin thickness histologically. In the subcutis, the quantity and size of anagen follicles were increased, whilst the quantity of atrophic follicles were decreased.\n\nCurrently, there is no documentation of potential probiotic-drug interactions in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A previous randomized controlled trial reported no adverse event associated with the use of synbiotics in breast cancer patients during the treatment period(9). Beneficial effects on chemotherapy-induced fatigue and abnormal stool consistency were also observed in subjects receiving synbiotics(9).\n\nBiotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some food and available as a dietary supplement for healthy hair and nails due to its role in keratin production. Most healthy individuals achieve adequate intake of biotin through a well-balanced diet. Current recommendation for biotin by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine stated that the daily adequate intake (AI) for adults is 30 mcg/day. Although biotin has been widely used as dietary supplement, data on the actual benefit of its effect on hair growth is limited(10).\n\nThe use of B. longum HK003 in alleviating chemotherapy-induced alopecia in breast cancer patients has not been explored. This pilot, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial aims to explore on the efficacy and safety of a synbiotic formula (BLHK03) in alleviating chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) in breast cancer patients."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer", "Hair Loss"], "keywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Hair Loss", "Chemotherapy", "Synbiotic"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "All subjects will be randomized into two group to take BLHK03 or active placebo (Vitamin B7) daily from the start of the chemotherapy cycle to 2 months after the final dose of chemotherapy.", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "maskingDescription": "Attending physicians, investigators performing assessments in clinic visits and study participants will be blinded to the group allocation until study completion.", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "INVESTIGATOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 40, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Active arm", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects will receive 1 sachet of BLHK03 daily from the start of the chemotherapy cycle to 2 months after the final dose of chemotherapy.", "interventionNames": ["Dietary Supplement: BLHK03"]}, {"label": "Placebo arm", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Subjects will receive 1 sachet of active placebo daily from the start of the chemotherapy cycle to 2 months after the final dose of chemotherapy.", "interventionNames": ["Dietary Supplement: Active placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT", "name": "BLHK03", "description": "BLHK03 consists of a blend of probiotics (20 billion CFU in 1 sachet) and prebiotic compounds", "armGroupLabels": ["Active arm"]}, {"type": "DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT", "name": "Active placebo", "description": "Active placebo contains 5mcg of Vitamin B7", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo arm"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females aged between 18 and 60 years who are newly diagnosed with stage I, II or III breast cancer\n* Planned chemotherapy including an anthracycline or taxane to be completed within 6 months\n* Mentally capable to participate in the study and provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre-existing female-pattern baldness resembling picture I-3 or higher on the Savin scale at baseline\n* History of hair transplantation, psoriasis or severe scalp infection\n* Undergoing or plan to receive scalp cooling\n* Plan for immunotherapy\n* Known pregnancy or lactating\n* Severe cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary and haematic lesions or other life-threatening conditions\n* Use of antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics one month prior to enrolment\n* No other alternative or complementary treatment for the cancer condition that may affect the gut microbiome analysis\n* History of allergy to probiotics or lactose\n* History of chemotherapy for other conditions", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "FEMALE", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "maximumAge": "60 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"centralContacts": [{"name": "Emily Chiu, BSc", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "97405209", "email": "emilychiu@g-niib.com"}, {"name": "Pui Kuan Cheong, MPH", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "97405209", "email": "jcheong@g-niib.com"}], "overallOfficials": [{"name": "Jessica Ching, PhD", "affiliation": "GenieBiome Limited", "role": "STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]}, "referencesModule": {"references": [{"pmid": "34987064", "type": "BACKGROUND", "citation": "Lam S, Zhang J, Yang K, Chu LC, Zhu W, Tang W, Chan FKL, Chan PKS, Wu WKK, Ng SC.
