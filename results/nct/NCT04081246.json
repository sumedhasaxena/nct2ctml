In this study, we shall investigate the efficacy of modified en bloc resection for patients with bladder tumours of \u22653cm in size.", "detailedDescription": "The biggest limiting factor of en bloc resection is the size of the bladder tumour. Resection of the bladder tumour is technically feasible, but the retrieval of specimen in one piece is restricted by the narrow size of the urethra. However, the greatest advantage of en bloc resection is to ensure complete local resection rather than the theoretical benefit of avoiding tumour re-implantation. Therefore, the concept of modified en bloc resection for large bladder tumours of \u22653cm has evolved. It is a hybrid technique involving piecemeal resection of the exophytic part of the bladder tumour, followed by en bloc resection of the tumour base. By resecting the exophytic part of the bladder tumour, the size of main tumour bulk can be reduced. By performing en bloc resection of the tumour base, the advantage of ensuring complete tumour resection beneath the submucosal plane can be preserved, and the tumour base specimen remains intact for histological assessment of the resection margins. Modified en bloc resection is a promising surgical technique which can potentially ensure complete tumour resection, reduce the need of second-look transurethral resection, and improve the oncological control of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in long run. It may also ensure proper staging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer at the first surgery, thus avoiding the need of second-look transurethral resection in under-staged patients.\n\nIn this study, we shall evaluate the efficacy of modified en bloc resection for patients with bladder tumours of \u22653cm. All patients will have MRI before modified en bloc resection. All patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be offered second-look transurethral resection in 2-6 weeks' time. All patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer but not distant metastasis will be offered radical cystectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion; for those who refuse or who are considered unfit for radical surgery, second-look transurethral resection will be offered. All patients will have a second MRI before the second surgery. The modified en bloc resection specimen results will be compared with the final pathology results in the second surgery. The presence of any residual or upstaging of disease will be determined. The results of the two sets of MRI will also be compared with the final pathology results. The accuracy of MRI in the evaluation of bladder cancer will be determined."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Bladder Cancer", "Bladder Neoplasm", "Bladder Tumor"], "keywords": ["Bladder cancer, bladder tumour, en bloc resection"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 30, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Modified en bloc resection", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "For patients undergoing modified en bloc resection, piecemeal resection of the exophytic part of the bladder tumour will be performed, followed by en bloc resection of the tumour base.", "interventionNames": ["Device: Bipolar transurethral modified en bloc resection of bladder tumour"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Bipolar transurethral modified en bloc resection of bladder tumour", "description": "Olympus TURis Bipolar HF-resection electrode (Model: WA22306D)", "armGroupLabels": ["Modified en bloc resection"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 to 80 years old with informed consent\n* Bladder tumours with maximal dimension of \u2265 3cm\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Bladder tumour detected during intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy (These patients warrant more aggressive treatment, i.e. radical cystectomy)\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate of \\<60mL/min.\n* Presence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease (History of acute myocardial infarction, presence of uncontrolled angina within 3 months before screening, New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, presence of ventricular arrhythmias, or presence of second-degree or third-degree heart block)\n* Presence of GOLD Stage III or IV chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n* History of bleeding disorder or use of anti-coagulant\n* Presence of other active malignancy\n* ECOG performance status \u2265 2 (Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry our any work activities.
