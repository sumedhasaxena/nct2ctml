Approximately 496 patients (\\~248 in each arm) from approximately 80 sites will be randomized in order to power the trial efficiently to measure a clinically meaningful improvement for the primary endpoint, PFS according to mRECIST based on the Investigator\u00b4s assessment.\n\nThe trial will include patients who have been diagnosed with intermediate-stage HCC by biopsy, cytology or diagnostic imaging, such as dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), according to the criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). Patients should have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, disease not amenable to curative treatment but amenable to loco-regional therapy with TACE (cTACE or DEB-TACE) or TARE, ECOG PS 0-1, Child-Pugh class A, and beyond up-to-7 criteria.\n\nThe trial will include the following phases:\n\n* Screening\n* Treatment\n* Follow-up\n\nRandomized patients will receive either:\n\nInvestigational arm (Arm A):\n\n-Regorafenib at a dose of 90 mg orally q.d. on days 1 to 21 of a 4-week cycle.\n\nIn combination with:\n\n-Pembrolizumab 400 mg using a 30-minutes i.v. infusion, on day 1 (D1) of a 6-week cycle.\n\nControl arm (Arm B):\n\n-Patients will be treated with TACE or TARE \"on-demand\" according to site's standard, with the goal of controlling all known liver lesions.\n\nIn both arms, patients will receive trial treatment (Rego-Pembro or TACE/TARE) until PD per mRECIST, unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that warrants permanent trial treatment
