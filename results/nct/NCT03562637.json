NOTE: inhaled steroids for treatment of asthma; and topical steroids are allowed during the study.\n* Any known uncontrolled concurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, including but not limited to ongoing or active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric disorders, or substance abuse.\n* Any known hypersensitivity to active/inactive ingredients in the study drug formulation or known severe allergy or anaphylaxis to fusion proteins.\n* Prior receipt of a glycoconjugate vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.\n* Known history or positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV positive), unless on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of therapy (note: HIV testing not required for study entry).\n* Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to randomization. Patients who have completed curative therapy and have undetectable viral load for HCV are eligible. For patients with evidence of chronic HBV infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy.
