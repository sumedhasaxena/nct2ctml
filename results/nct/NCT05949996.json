Specifically, using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aim to test if a systematic symptom distress screening program (i.e. using the five implementation strategies including training, audit, feedback, facilitation and adaptable workflow) increases the proportion of eligible patients screened and referred compared to usual control under which no implementation strategies will be used to facilitate the adoption of the systematic symptom distress screening and referral. The investigator hypothesize that (1) the intervention will increase the proportion of eligible patients screened; (2) the intervention will increase the proportion of patients with moderate to severe symptom distress referred for psychosocial support.\n\nFor process evaluation, this study will use qualitative methods to assess the experience and response to the implementation program."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Neoplasms"], "keywords": ["Implementation study", "Symptom distress screening", "Survivorship care"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "interventionModelDescription": "This study will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design in which the intervention is introduced stepwise across study units.

At each time point, a new group of 2 or 3 study units will cross over from the control condition to the implementation condition.
