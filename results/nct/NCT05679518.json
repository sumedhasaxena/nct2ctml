Patients receiving CALM intervention or ConquerFear intervention, compared to those receiving a basic cancer care intervention will show a reduction in fear of cancer progression.\n2. Both CALM intervention and ConquerFear intervention will be equally effective in reducing fear of cancer progression.\n3.
