Moreover, this protective effect may allow surveillance intervals to be lengthened, by modifying long-term outcome of high-risk subgroup.", "detailedDescription": "Between April 2021 and July 2022, our group completed a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong. \\[ENDOAID-TRAIN study; NCT04838951\\] 856 subjects undergoing colonoscopies were randomized 1:1 to receive colonoscopies with CADe (ENDO-AID, Olympus Co., Japan) or standard colonoscopies (control). Our study proved that AI-assisted colonoscopies could increase the overall ADR, especially small-to-medium size adenomas. It remains questionable whether the increased detection and removal of these non-advanced adenomas can be translated into any sustained long-term benefit. The impact of this AI-driven intensive surveillance on general population and healthcare system is also largely unknown. In this research project, we aim to assess the long-term effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy on adenoma recurrence and PCCRC prevention, by conducting a real-world, prospective study with longitudinal extension from a randomized trial."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Screening Colonscopy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 775, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention arm", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "CADe system will be used during withdrawal phase of colonscopy", "interventionNames": ["Device: ENDO-AID CADe"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "ENDO-AID CADe", "description": "ENDO-AID CADe will be used during the withdrawal process of the colonscopy", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention arm"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects are eligible if:\n\n(i) They underwent randomization to receive colonoscopy with/without CADe in ENDOAID-TRAIN study \\[NCT04838951\\]; (ii) They are fit and willing to undergo surveillance colonoscopy at year 3; (iii) Written informed consent obtained.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects will be excluded from the study if they have any of the followings:\n\n(i) Incomplete colonoscopy during index procedure; (ii) Known residual colorectal neoplasia not removed (except hyperplastic polyps); (iii) Underwent unscheduled interval colonoscopy before year 3; (iv) Contraindications to surveillance colonoscopy at year 3; (v) Advanced comorbid (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 4 or above); (vi) History of CRC, hereditary polyposis syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease; (vii) History of colectomy at any time point.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}, "contactsLocationsModule": {"centralContacts": [{"name": "Felix Sia", "role": "CONTACT", "phone": "26370428", "email": "felixsia@cuhk.edu.hk"}]}}, "hasResults": false}
