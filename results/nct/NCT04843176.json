It is the 3rd most common cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. The five-year survival rates of liver cancer differ greatly with disease staging, ranging from 91.5% in early-stage to 11% in late-stage. The early and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer is paramount in improving cancer survival. Liver cancer is diagnosed radiologically via cross sectional imaging, e.g. computed tomography (CT), without the routine use of liver biopsy. However, with current internationally-recommended radiological reporting methods, up to 49% of liver lesions may be inconclusive, resulting in repeated scans and a delay in diagnosis and treatment. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that that can accurately diagnosed liver cancer has been developed. Based on an interim analysis, the algorithm achieved a high diagnostic accuracy. The AI algorithm is now ready for implementation.\n\nThis study aims to prospective validate this AI algorithm in comparison with the current standard of radiological reporting in a randomized manner in the at-risk population undergoing triphasic contrast CT. This research project is totally independent and separated from the actual clinical reporting of the CT scan by the duty radiologist. The primary study outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of liver cancer, which will be unbiasedly based on a composite clinical reference standard.", "detailedDescription": "Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The main disease burden is found in East Asia, in which the age-standardized incidence is 26.8 and 8.7 per 100,000 in men and women respectively. In 2017, among the top 10 most common cancers in Hong Kong, liver cancer had the highest case fatality rate of 84.6%. The five-year survival rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differ greatly with disease staging, ranging from 91.5% in \\<2 cm with surgical resection to 11% in \\>5 cm with adjacent organ involvement. The early and accurate diagnosis of HCC is paramount in improving cancer survival.\n\nUnlike other common cancers, HCC is diagnosed by highly characteristic dynamic patterns on contrast-enhanced cross sectional imaging, without the need of pathological confirmation. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) was established to standardize the lexicon, interpretation and communication of radiological findings related to HCC. However, up to 49% of nodules identified in computed tomography (CT) in the at-risk population are categorized by LI-RADS as indeterminate, further delaying the establishment of diagnosis.\n\nThere are currently studies pioneering the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of medical imaging. A interdisciplinary research team of clinicians, radiologists and statistical scientists, based on the clinical and radiological database of over 4,000 liver images, and have developed an AI algorithm to accurately diagnose liver cancer on CT. Based on retrospective data, an interim analysis found the AI algorithm able to achieve a diagnostic accuracy of \\>97% and a negative predictive value of \\>99%.\n\nCan this novel prototype AI algorithm achieve a better performance in diagnosing HCC in the at-risk population when compared to LI-RADS? This question is especially relevant when the key to improved survival is early diagnosis, of which AI can potentially improve. Currently, errors in radiologist reporting are estimated to be 3-5% on a day-to-basis, equating to 40 million errors per annum worldwide. This prototype algorithm can be a solution to reduce human misinterpretation of radiological findings."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["HCC", "Liver Cancer"], "keywords": ["HCC", "liver cancer", "AI", "deep learning", "CT", "imaging"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Scanned images are randomized individually 1:1 to either the prototype AI algorithm or LI-RADS criteria interpretation by two specialist gastrointestinal radiologists", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "maskingDescription": ".
