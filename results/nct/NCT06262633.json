Men aged 50-75 with PSA \\< 20ng/mL and clinically significant prostate cancer with 1-2 MRI lesions \u226415mm and ISUP grade group \u22643 will be recruited. Transperineal targeted Microwave Ablation of the prostate tumor(s) will be done with repeated ablations by a single microwave needle guided by MRI-Ultrasound fusion and organ-based tracking navigation. The primary outcome is any clinically significant prostate cancer detected on biopsy of treated area(s) per patient at 6 months."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Prostate Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 103, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) for localized prostate cancer using organ based tracking (OBT) navigation", "interventionNames": ["Device: Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) for localized prostate cancer using organ based tracking (OBT) navigation"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) for localized prostate cancer using organ based tracking (OBT) navigation", "description": "Targeted microwave ablation (TMA) is a novel treatment developed for focal treatment of prostate cancer, and it is applied with precise navigation guidance under the organ-based tracking (OBT) mechanism.", "armGroupLabels": ["Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA)"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
