First, the investigators will test the effect of a one-off, multidisciplinary team face-to-face assessment (namely, the cancer survivorship clinic) with personalized advice on symptom management, lifestyle modification and anxiety management in reducing the case prevalence of symptom distress, increasing the proportion meeting the weight management criteria, and improving self-efficacy and health-related quality of life among cancer survivors in post-treatment survivorship, in comparison to those receiving skills-based pamphlets for symptom management and lifestyle recommendations. Secondly, this study aims to explore if a step-up targeted personalized intervention is more effective for patients who continue to have symptom distress and/or not to meet the weight management criteria if patients have attended cancer survivorship clinic (i.e. the embedded adaptive intervention) in comparison to those receiving skills-based pamphlets."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Physical Symptom Distress", "Weight Management", "Neoplasms"], "keywords": ["Physical symptom distress", "Weight management", "Self-efficacy in managing cancer", "Health-related quality of life", "Survivorship intervention", "Sequential multiple assessment randomized controlled trial", "psychooncology"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "SEQUENTIAL", "interventionModelDescription": "First stage intervention: We will use a block randomization with randomly permuted block sizes of 2,4, and 6 to ensure close balance of the numbers in each arm.
