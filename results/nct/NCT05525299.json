However, no reminiscence-based interventions are specifically developed for older people with cancer have been developed and evaluated.\n\nTarget Population:\n\nCancer survivors aged 65 years old and above with a mild cognitive impairment identified by the HK-MoCA 5-Min Protocol cognitive assessment.\n\nIntervention:\n\nThis research project aims to implement a brief reminiscence-based intervention that includes six reminiscence chatting sessions among older cancer survivors. The proposed reminiscence-based intervention has great potential to provide psychological and spiritual care as well as comfort to those who are weak, aged and are in need of assistance.\n\nStudy Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the effect of a reminiscence-based life review intervention on copying with existential suffering including meaning of life (primary outcome), cognitive function, psychological distress and social support (secondary outcomes) in older cancer survivors\n2. To explore older cancer survivors' experience of the intervention regarding the impact of the intervention on their existential suffering\n\nStudy Method:\n\nThe investigator will recruit 116 voluntary elder patients from the outpatient oncology clinics of the Queen Mary Hospital to participate in the study. They will be individually randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive usual care or the brief reminiscence-based intervention at home. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 6-week follow-up (T2). A qualitative interview regarding the feedback on the intervention will be undertaken only in the intervention group."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Existential Suffering", "Meaning of Life", "Cognitive Function", "Psychological Distress", "Social Support"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "SINGLE", "whoMasked": ["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 116, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "A brief reminiscence-based life review with six themes to recall subjects' memory through the life review reminiscence intervention will be given.
