Some pathogenic species of bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia Coli and Bacteroides fragilis, have shown to be significantly enriched in CRC patients. This gut dysbiosis process also brings with its diagnostic potential for recurrent adenomas. Previous study found a panel of bacterial gene markers, including \"m3\" from Lachnoclostridium, F. nucleatum (Fn), Bacteroides clarus (Bc) and Clostridium hathewayi (Ch) could be used in detecting adenoma recurrence after polypectomy in a retrospective study. In addition, these microbial biomarkers may have prognostic potential and provide an option as therapeutic target.\n\nProbiotics, including the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, have shown to be able to inhibit tumorigenesis and progression of CRC in animal studies. Prebiotics are non-digestible dietary ingredients with protective effects against cancer by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of beneficial colonic microbiota. The combination of probiotics and prebiotics, known as synbiotic, may be more efficient in preventing CRC than either one alone.\n\nThe investigators' unpublished data showed that the new probiotic formula containing Bifidobacterium strains has a negative correlation with CRC-related bacterial gene markers. Subjects treated with SMT04 showed significantly higher levels of the individual Bifidobacterium species at week 2 to week 5 compared with baseline levels. There was a significant decrease in the bacterial gene markers (Fn, m3 and 4Bac CRC risk score) from week 2 to week 12 compared with baseline levels in the SMT04 group but not in the control group. The synbiotic formula (SMT04) is the combination of probiotic formula and several heat-resistant prebiotics. It remains unclear that whether this synbiotic formula can produce a sustained effect in reduction of adenoma recurrence and colorectal neoplasia related bacterial gene markers in long-term."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Colorectal Adenoma", "Colorectal Cancer"], "keywords": ["Adenoma recurrence", "Bacterial marker"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "PREVENTION", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "QUADRUPLE", "whoMasked": ["PARTICIPANT", "CARE_PROVIDER", "INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 246, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention arm", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Receive SMT04 formula", "interventionNames": ["Other: SMT04 formula"]}, {"label": "Placebo arm", "type": "PLACEBO_COMPARATOR", "description": "Receive active placebo", "interventionNames": ["Other: Active placebo"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "SMT04 formula", "description": "The SMT04 formula is a synbiotic containing probiotics and prebiotics", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention arm"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Active placebo", "description": "The active placebo is 2 mg Vitamin C with an inert substance made of starch filler.
