To test the sensitivity and specificity of using HPV DNA from urine for the detection of pre-cervical or/and cervical cancer.\n2. If HPV DNA is not a promising biomarker, other biomarkers will be explored.\n3. To develop an effective and non-invasive detection method of the pre-cervical or/and cervical cancer. in Women with menstruation.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nTo validate whether HPV DNA from urine could be used as a non-invasive means for the detection of pre-cervical or cervical cancer\n\nParticipants will\n\n1. Join the briefing session of the study\n2. Sign the consent form and health questionnaire\n3. Submit the cervical medical report(s) within 3 months or perform sponsored pap smear test\n4. Collect the urine sample\n\nIf there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare The diseased group and the healthy group according to the medical reports they provided to see if HPV DNA from urine is a promising biomarker for the detection of pre-cervical or cervical cancer", "detailedDescription": "First stage of study: Female subjects within the age group will first attend an online research briefing session. After the online briefing session, the participant is provided an opportunity to join a private 1-to-1 consultation session, which enables the participant to be more familiar with the details of the research content, consent form, study procedures, and data confidentiality. If they have no further questions regarding the research content, consent form, etc. during the consultation session. They will sign the consent for participating in the study, they will fill in a questionnaire (attached) and clinic pap smear application form (attached). The questionnaire helps the research team to understand the subject's medical, gynaecological, and sexual histories; a unique identifier code will be given to each subject.\n\nSecond Stage of study: The research team will select the subjects based on the questionnaire answers. If the selected subjects have undergone pap test/ HPV test or coloscopy recently, within 3 months, they will submit the related medical record with the unique identifier number to us. If the selected subjects have not undergone pap test/ HPV test or coloscopy recently, within 3 months, they will be sponsored to Pap test or/and HPV genotyping or/and colposcopy at the designated hospitals or clinics. When their Pap test or/and HPV genotyping or/and colposcopy results are available, they or the designated hospitals/ clinics will send us the related medical reports with the unique identifier number.\n\nThird Stage of Study: The participants will be further selected according to the medical records submitted. If the participants were selected to enter the third stage of the study, the selected subjects will submit their urine sample to us with a unique identifier number given."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cervical Cancer"], "keywords": ["pre-cervical cancer", "cervical cancer", "CIN", "Sanitary pad", "non-invasive detection method", "HPV"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "SCREENING", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 300, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Collect HPV DNA from urine", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Diagnostic Test: Collect HPV DNA from urine"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DIAGNOSTIC_TEST", "name": "Collect HPV DNA from urine", "description": "Use a sample collector to collect urine", "armGroupLabels": ["Collect HPV DNA from urine"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Female aged between 18 to 65\n* Have menstruation\n* Had sex before\n* Can read and write Chinese/ English\n* Without taking any medication (Except nutritional supplements, traditional Chinese medicine, and health care products etc.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n\u2022 Subjects who used medication will be excluded from the sample collection.
