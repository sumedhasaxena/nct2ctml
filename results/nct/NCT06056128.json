In this study, investigators will evaluate the feasibility of the Galaxy System, which uses a built-in real-time navigation system called TiLT Technology, to both access and biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Lung Cancer", "Nodes, Lung"], "keywords": ["Lung cancer, robotic assisted bronchoscopy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "DIAGNOSTIC", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 25, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Robotic assisted bronchoscopy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Robotic assisted bronchoscopy procedures performed using the Galaxy System.", "interventionNames": ["Device: Robotic assisted bronchoscopy"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Robotic assisted bronchoscopy", "description": "Robotic assisted bronchoscopy of peripheral airways for the purpose of biopsying lung lesions", "armGroupLabels": ["Robotic assisted bronchoscopy"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
