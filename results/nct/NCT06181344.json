This study hypothesize that the implementation program will increase (i) the proportion of eligible patients screened and (ii) the proportion of patients with high fear of cancer referred for psychosocial support. For process evaluation, this study aims to use qualitative methods to assess the patients' and service providers' experience of the implementation program, and identify contextual factors (e.g., potential barriers and facilitators) likely to influence its adoption, implementation, and sustainability."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Fear of Cancer Recurrence", "Cancer"], "keywords": ["implementation study", "Screening and referral program"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "CROSSOVER", "interventionModelDescription": "This study will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design in which the intervention is introduced stepwise across study units.
