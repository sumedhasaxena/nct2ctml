There will be a greater FCR improvement in cancer survivors receiving eConquerFear-HK intervention vs those in the active control group.\n2. There will be a greater MCQ reduction in cancer survivors receiving eConquerFear-HK intervention vs those in the active control group.\n3. There will be greater improvements in secondary outcomes (psychological distress and quality of life) in cancer survivors receiving eConquerFear-HK intervention vs those in the active control group.\n4. Cancer survivors receiving eConquerFear-HK intervention will perceive the intervention useful for managing their FCR and be satisfied with the intervention.\n5.
