Postoperative patients carry a poor prognosis with an estimated five-year disease-specific survival rate of 50%. To improve overall survival and reduce the recurrent risk, chemotherapy is recommended as a standard of care. However, currently in Hong Kong, neoadjuvant (preoperational) chemotherapy and adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy are not commonly or regularly provided due to the concern of the potential harm from both physicians and patients. Recently, genetic signature from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a pivotal biomarker for detecting caner in early stage and molecular residual disease (MRD). With strengths of non-invasive and superior sensitivity, ctDNA is hopefully to serve as a cancer-agnostic surrogate analyte for risk stratification of tumor recurrence, thereby guiding individually tailored treatment. Therefore, this study is proposed to exploratively assess the benefit of ctDNA-guided approach for postoperative adjuvant therapy."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Muscle Invasive Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma", "Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma"], "keywords": ["circulating tumor DNA", "ctDNA", "molecular residual disease"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 20, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy arm (GC arm)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients in this group will receive adjuvant chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin, prior to radiological progression", "interventionNames": ["Drug: gemcitabine", "Drug: Cisplatin"]}, {"label": "Standard management arm (SM arm)", "type": "OTHER", "description": "Patients in this group will receive chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin only after radiological progression is observed", "interventionNames": ["Drug: gemcitabine", "Drug: Cisplatin"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "gemcitabine", "description": "1,000 mg/m2 intravenous gemcitabine on day 1 and day 8", "armGroupLabels": ["Gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy arm (GC arm)", "Standard management arm (SM arm)"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Cisplatin", "description": "70 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin (split into 2 doses on day 1 and day 8)", "armGroupLabels": ["Gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy arm (GC arm)", "Standard management arm (SM arm)"]}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. aged 18-70 years old;\n2. a score of \u22641 for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status;\n3. receiving radical cystectomy (with lymph node dissection) or nephroureterectomy;\n4. histologically confirmed (surgical specimen) muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, and the major histological type should be transitional cell carcinoma;\n5.
