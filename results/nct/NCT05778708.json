Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: 1) Tai-Chi group, 2) aerobic exercise group, or 3) self-management control group. Both the Tai-Chi and aerobic exercise groups will attend twice-weekly group classes for 16 weeks (32 total contact hours). The self-management control group will receive written information regarding the recommended level of physical activity.", "detailedDescription": "Late-stage lung cancer patients (n = 318) meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized into one of three groups: 1) Tai-Chi group, 2) aerobic exercise group, or 3) self-management control group. Both the Tai-Chi and aerobic exercise groups will attend twice-weekly group classes for 16 weeks (32 total contact hours). The self-management control group will receive written information regarding the recommended level of physical activity. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tai-Chi and aerobic exercise in alleviating the emotional symptom cluster (primary outcome) and individual symptoms (sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, fatigue), outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (mid-point assessment), 16 weeks (post-intervention), and 28 weeks (12-weeks post-intervention). A linear mixed-effects model will be used to study the between-group differences in outcomes. In addition, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and cardiorespiratory fitness will be evaluated at each data collection point, and structural equation modeling will be used for subsequent mediation analysis to determine their mediating role in outcome changes. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to understand patients' experience and evaluation of the interventions."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Advanced Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "SUPPORTIVE_CARE", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "DOUBLE", "maskingDescription": "Except for the primary research assistant who will inform the patients of their group allocation, all researchers on the team will be blinded to patients' group assignment.", "whoMasked": ["INVESTIGATOR", "OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 318, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Tai-Chi intervention group", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The standardized 16-form Yang-style Tai-Chi exercise set will be adopted.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Tai-Chi intervention"]}, {"label": "Aerobic exercise intervention", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "The aerobic exercise class will be designed to cover both aerobic and resistance exercises.", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Aerobic exercise intervention"]}, {"label": "Self-management control group", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Patients in this group will receive written information regarding the recommended levels of exercise (i.e., at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise every week) that they can perform at home (self-management) while continuing to receive their standard treatment.
