summary: TAPISTRY is a Phase II, global, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort study
  designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy
  as single agents or in rational, specified combinations in participants with unresectable,
  locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors determined to harbor specific oncogenic
  genomic alterations or who are tumor mutational burden (TMB)-high as identified
  by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Participants with solid tumors
  will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results
  at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their
  genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype,
  will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified,
  will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable
  toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever
  occurs first.
