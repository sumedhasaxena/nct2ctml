# nct2ctml

The **nct2ctml** repository is a specialized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) application for clinical trial data. It provides a CLI interface for pulling and mapping trial data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api#extapi) to the Clinical Trial Markup Language ([CTML](https://matchminer.gitbook.io/matchminer/deployment/ctml-and-trial-curation)) schema format.

## Workflow
- For the trials present on clinicaltrials.gov:
  1. The trials are pulled and synced automatically via 'pull' command. The trials are saved in `cache\nct` directory.
  2. Once pulled, they are converted to CTML format via 'map' command. The CTML files are saved in `cache\ctml` directory.
  3. Once mapped, manual review is encouraged to verify that the AI generated diagnosis and match criteria is correct. Once reviewed, the files are saved in `ctml\reviewed` directory.
  4. Further, they are converted to json and placed under `ctml/json` directory for matchminer-admin workflow to pick up and inserted to matchminer DB.

- For local trials, not present on any international trial repository,
  1. A CTML file is generated manually and placed in `ctml/pending` directory.
  2. A manual review is done to make sure that the captured information is correct and post-verification, file is saved in `ctml\reviewed` directory.
  3. Further, they are converted to json and placed under `ctml/json` directory for matchminer-admin workflow to pick up and inserted to matchminer DB.
  4. For manual creation or editing of CTML files, please refer to the guide at [`doc/trial_creation_guide.md`](doc/trial_creation_guide.md).

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumedhasaxena/nct2ctml.git
   cd nct2ctml
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the CLI from the project root:

```bash
python main.py [-h] {pull,map} ...
```

### Commands

#### Pull NCT study data
- Pull all studies:
  ```bash
  python main.py pull --all
  ```
- Pull a specific study:
  ```bash
  python main.py pull --nct_id NCT_ID
  ```

#### Map NCT IDs to CTML
- Map all NCT files (uses config default cutoff):
  ```bash
  python main.py map --all
  ```
- Map all NCT files with custom cutoff days:
  ```bash
  python main.py map --all --cutoff-days 14
  ```
- Map a specific NCT ID:
  ```bash
  python main.py map --nct_id NCT_ID
  ```

### Configuration

The mapping cutoff is configurable in `config.py`:
```python
MAPPING_CUTOFF_DAYS = 1  # Default: 1 day
```

This determines how far back to look for updated trials when using `map --all`. Trials with `entry_last_updated_date` within the cutoff period will be processed.

## Shell script

Instead of running individual commands, sync_trials.sh can be used for running the full automated workflow.
The script will:
1. Ensure correct conda environment is created with required dependencies. 
2. Run `python main.py pull --all`
3. Run `python main.py map --all`

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x sync_trials.sh

./sync_trials.sh

```

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  ```
- **Run a specific test:**
  ```bash
  python -m unittest tests.test_your_module.TestGetGeneInfo.test_get_gene_info -v
  ```
