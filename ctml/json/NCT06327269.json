    "summary": "The challenge of LDLT to HCC is that tumors with a high risk of recurrence have a high rate of recurrence after liver transplantation, and there is no appropriate treatment to prevent HCC recurrence after transplantation in these patients. Using the advance proton therapy or yttrium 90 as a more aggressive down-staging therapy may contribute to change tumor behavior. It can be used to get a better treatment response and tumor necrosis before LDLT. As a result, it will improve recurrence-free survival and overall survival rate, especially in high-risk groups. In addition, lenvatinib is approved for using in patients with advanced liver cancer because its overall survival rate is not less than sorafenib in clinical trials. A new generation of targeted therapies will be applied to adjuvant therapy after LDLT.",
