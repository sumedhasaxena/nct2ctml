The investigational product in this clinical trial is tislelizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor.\n\nAs a rationale for using PD-1 inhibitors in patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma, their efficacy has been proved several times mostly in patients with relapsed NK/T-cell lymphoma.\n\nPatients with low-stage NK/T-cell lymphoma usually receive high-concentration cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, with treatment response rates of approximately 60 to 80%, but 80-90% of them experience hematological and non-hematologic toxicities during treatment.\n\nTherefore, this study intends to determine the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor(Tislelizumab) combined with radiotherapy as a first-line therapy compared with pre-existing cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy in patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma with low stage and International Prognostic Index.",
