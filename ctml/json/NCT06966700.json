These cancers have zero or a low amount of a protein called HER2 and other proteins that attach to the hormones estrogen or progesterone.\n\nSacituzumab tirumotecan (also known as sac-TMT or MK-2870), the study medicine, is a type of targeted therapy. A targeted therapy is a treatment that works to control how specific types of cancer cells grow and spread.\n\nThe main goals of this study are to learn if people who receive sac-TMT, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy:\n\n* Have fewer cancer cells found in the tumors and lymph nodes removed during surgery compared to those who receive only pembrolizumab and chemotherapy\n* Live longer without the cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to people who receive only pembrolizumab with chemotherapy",
