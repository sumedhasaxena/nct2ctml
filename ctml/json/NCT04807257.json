IUdR is an iodinated thymidine analogue that is preferentially incorporated into DNA in rapid growing cells. The AUTRON Therapy System generates characteristic X-Ray photons around 33.4 keV, matching the K-edge energy of Iodine (33.17 keV), which can efficiently induce Auger electron emissions from IUdR in cancer DNA, resulting in extensive DNA damage and cancer cell death.",
