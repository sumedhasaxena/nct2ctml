    "summary": "With the development of KIT mutation and KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (GlivecTM, Novartis), survival of patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has significantly improved. Recently, sunitinib (SuteneTM, Pfizer) and regorafenib (StivargaTM, Bayer) have been proven to be effective as second- and third-line treatment, respectively in GIST patients who failed to imatinib treatment.\n\nHowever, almost all patients eventually experience disease progression due to the development of drug resistance to first-line imatinib, second-line sunitinib treatment, and third-line regorafenib.\n\nHistoric data suggest that GISTs do not respond to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but systematic unbiased screening has not been performed. A recent large-scaled chemotherapy susceptibility screening with GIST cells showed that among a total of 89 chemotherapies, 37 have anti-cancer effect in at least one type of GIST cells. It was suggested that of these agents, transcriptional inhibitors and chemotherapies such as topoisomerase II, paclitaxel, and bortezomib would be effective.\n\nBased on this study result, Asan Medical Center has recently performed a phase II study for efficacy and safety evaluation of paclitaxel in patients with advanced and/or metastatic GIST after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. Although paclitaxel showed limited anti-tumor efficacy, it was more effective in patients with low P-glycoprotein expression.\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or advanced GIST with low P-glycoprotein expression after failure of at least imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib.",
