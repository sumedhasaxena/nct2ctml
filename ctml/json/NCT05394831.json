In Part A of the study, dose escalation is carried out where MTD is evaluated using Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design in subjects with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutation of C797S or T790M. In Part B, dose exploration is carried out to further evaluate the safety of JIN-A02 and to determine the RP2D using 2 preliminary effective dose levels and with the help of a safety review committee (SRC) in advanced NSCLC subjects harboring EGFR mutant C797S or T790M. In Part C dose expansion study, subjects with EGFR mutant who show disease progression after receiving standard anticancer therapy, including approved EGFR-TKI therapy with activity against T790M such as Osimertinib and/or no more than one platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy, are divided into 5 different cohorts based on the EGFR mutation and the anti-tumor activity of JIN-A02 is evaluated. Before enrollment in the study, the EGFR mutant profile is determined using either tumor tissue and/or plasma ctDNA. The profile is determined locally through a test method approved by the sponsor. The sponsor reviews and approves each potential subject for enrollment. Study eligibility evaluation will utilize local test(s).",
