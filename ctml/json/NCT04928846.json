Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. The purpose of this study is to determine if telisotuzumab vedotin works better than docetaxel and to assess how safe telisotuzumab vedotin is in adult participants with NSCLC who have previously been treated. Change in disease activity and adverse events will be assessed.\n\nTelisotuzumab vedotin is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NSCLC. Participants will be randomly assigned a treatment of Teliso-V or Docetax at an 1:1 ratio. Each group receives intravenous (IV) infusion of telisotuzumab vedotin or IV infusion of docetaxel. Approximately 698 adult participants with c-Met overexpressing NSCLC will be enrolled in the study in approximately 300 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive IV telisotuzumab vedotin every 2 weeks or docetaxel every 3 weeks until meeting study drug discontinuation criteria.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",
