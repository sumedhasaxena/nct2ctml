Previously untreated patients who received adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy are eligible if the last dose of the systemic treatment was completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment. For untreated patients in the arm with LY3537982 in combination with pembrolizumab noted above, a single cycle of pembrolizumab may be initiated within 21 days prior to enrollment. For untreated patients in the arm of LY3537982 in combination with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and platinum therapy, a single cycle of any or all of the drugs other than LY3537982 may be initiated within 21 days prior to enrollment. Start of study treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery from treatment-related toxicity.",
