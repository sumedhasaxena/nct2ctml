Patients must have experienced benefit from previous anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy for at least 4 months based on investigator-assessed disease stability or response prior to developing documented disease progression. Patients must have also received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, either in combination or in sequence with anti-PD-(L)1, unless patient was ineligible to receive such treatment.",
        "* Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell histology, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy and a VEGF targeted therapy as monotherapy or in combination. Patients should have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy.",
        "* Cutaneous melanoma, previously treated with anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy. Patients should have documented disease progression following anti-PD(L)1-containing therapy. Patients with BRAF V600-mutant melanoma must have also received prior therapy with a BRAF V600 inhibitor, with or without a MEK inhibitor.",

        "* Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic anal cancer (squamous), thymic carcinoma, MSI-H CRC, esophagogastric cancer, mesothelioma, and HNSCC, all na\u00efve to anti-PD(L)1 therapy and for whom anti PD(L)1 therapy is not available.",
        "* Triple negative breast cancer with historic PD-L1 CPS \u2265 1%, must have received at least one line of chemotherapy. In addition, these patients must have previously received sacituzumab govitecan, and in the case of a BRCA mutation a PARP inhibitor, if these treatments are locally approved and accessible to the patient.",

        "Exclude - * Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur may be considered. Patients previously exposed to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who are adequately treated for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.",
