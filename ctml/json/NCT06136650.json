The primary study hypotheses are that opevesostat is superior to alternative abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide with respect to radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and overall survival (OS), in androgen receptor ligand binding domain (AR LBD) mutation positive and negative participants.",
