Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc (hepatitis B core antigen)\\] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.",
