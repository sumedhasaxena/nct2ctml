The study medicine raludotatug deruxtecan (also called MK-5909, R-DXd, or DS-6000a) is a type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.\n\nThe main goal of this study is to learn if the cancer responds to treatment (gets smaller or goes away).",
