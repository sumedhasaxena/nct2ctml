Researchers want to learn if adding MK-1084 (the study medicine) and cetuximab to mFOLFOX6 can treat locally advanced or mCRC with the KRAS G12C mutation. MK-1084 and cetuximab are targeted therapies.\n\nThe goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* About the safety of MK-1084 with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 and if people tolerate the treatments\n* If people who receive MK-1084 with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 live longer without mCRC growing or spreading compared to people who receive mFOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab.",
