The primary hypotheses are that sacituzumab tirumotecan is: (1) superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR in NSCLC with EGFR mutations; and (2) superior to chemotherapy with respect to overall survival (OS) in NSCLC with EGFR mutations.",
