Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or vasectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (only if used in combination with another mentioned method), or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures and other medications sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. If a female patient becomes pregnant, study therapy must be discontinued immediately. Lastly, b) the period for use of contraception after last dose of pemetrexed or carboplatin should be determined by the domestic drug labels and/or institutional standard clinical practice. For S Korea, contraception is to be used for 6 months after the last dose.",
