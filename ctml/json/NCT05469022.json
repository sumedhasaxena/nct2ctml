However, the patients with early resected Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR)-mutated lung cancers have high recurrence rate. The efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment by first-generation EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor(TKI) has been demonstrated, however, that of the third-generation EGFR-TKI(lazertinib) has not yet been fully investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant Lazertinib in resectable EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and clinical application of extracellular vesicles(EVs) based BALF liquid biopsy to identify EGFR mutation without invasive tissue biopsy.",
