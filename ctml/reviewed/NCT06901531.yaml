summary: 'Zolbetuximab is being studied in people with cancer in and around the stomach
  or where the food pipe (esophagus) joins the stomach, called gastroesophageal junction
  (GEJ) cancer. Zolbetuximab with chemotherapy may be used to treat stomach and GEJ
  cancer when the cancer cells do not have a protein called HER2 (human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2) on their surface (HER2-negative) but do have a protein
  called Claudin 18.2 (Claudin 18.2-positive). Zolbetuximab is thought to work by
  attaching to the Claudin 18.2 protein in their tumor, which switches on the body''s
  immune system to attack the tumor. Certain stomach and GEJ cancers may be treated
  with immunotherapy, which helps the body''s immune system fight cancer. This study
  will give more information about how well zolbetuximab works when given with an
  immunotherapy medicine called pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In this study, adults
  with stomach cancer or GEJ cancer will either be given zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab
  and chemotherapy or a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A placebo looks
  like zolbetuximab but doesn''t have any medicine in it.


  The main aim of the study is to check how long people with stomach cancer and GEJ
  cancer live after treatment with zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy
  compared to placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.


  Adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic stomach cancer or GEJ cancer
  can take part. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable
  means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread
  to other parts of the body. A tumor sample (biopsy) of their cancer will have the
  Claudin 18.2 protein, PD-L1 protein, and be HER2-negative. They may have been previously
  treated with certain standard therapies. People cannot take part if they need to
  take medicines to suppress their immune system, have blockages or bleeding in their
  gut, have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers
  in the nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.


  The study treatments are either zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy,
  or placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. People who take part will receive
  just 1 of the study treatments by chance. The people in the study and the study
  doctors will not know who takes which of the study treatments. Study treatment will
  be given in 6-week (42-day) cycles. The study treatment is mainly given to people
  slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will receive
  study treatment as follows: Zolbetuximab or placebo: 1 infusion every 2 or 3 weeks
  (2 or 3 infusions in a cycle) together with: Chemotherapy (1 of the following types
  of chemotherapy): 1. CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion of oxaliplatin
  every 3 weeks (2 infusions in a cycle). People will also take 1 tablet of capecitabine
  twice a day for 2 weeks (14 days) at the start of each cycle (Day 1) and again in
  the middle of each cycle (Day 22). After 8 study treatments people will receive
  capecitabine only. 2. Modified FOLFOX6 or mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid
  and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion every 2 weeks (3 infusions in a cycle). After 12 study
  treatments people will receive folinic acid and fluorouracil only, instead of mFOLFOX6.
  Pembrolizumab: 1 infusion every 3 or 6 weeks (1 or 2 infusions in a cycle). People
  can be in the study and will receive study treatment until their cancer worsens,
  they cannot tolerate the study treatment, or they need to start another cancer treatment.
  People may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. People will visit the clinic
  on certain days to receive their study treatment and have health checks. The study
  doctors will check if people had any medical problems from taking zolbetuximab or
  the other study treatments. On some visits they will have scans to check for any
  changes in their cancer. People will have the option of giving a tumor sample if
  they stop treatment because their cancer has worsened. People will visit the clinic
  after they stop their study treatment. People will be asked about any medical problems
  and will have a health check. People will continue to have scans every 9 or 12 weeks
  to check for any changes in their cancer. They will have telephone health checks
  every 3 months. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on
  the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not.'
