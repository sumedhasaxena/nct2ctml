- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Prior treatment with ADC that consists of an exatecan derivative that
  is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.
- Exclude - 2. Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to either the drug
  substances or inactive ingredients in the drug products.
- Exclude - 3. Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal
  antibodies.
- Exclude - 4. Medical history of MI within 6 months before enrollment or symptomatic
  CHF (New York Heart Association class II to IV). Participants with troponin levels
  above ULN at screening (as defined by the manufacturer), and without any MI-related
  symptoms should have a cardiologic consultation during the Screening Period to rule
  out MI.

  of participant's sex ) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead ECG.
- Exclude - 6. Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids,
  has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled
  out by imaging at screening.
