summary: The main aim of this study is to find out how well elritercept works in lowering
  the need for RBC transfusions. Other aims are to learn how well elritercept works
  in reducing the need for RBC transfusions over longer periods of time or in adults
  with high transfusion needs. The study will also check on how safe elritercept is
  and how well it is tolerated.
