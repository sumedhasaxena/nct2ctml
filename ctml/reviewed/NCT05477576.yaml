  control for at least 6 months following Lu-177 SSA. No time limit is defined between
  177Lu-SSA treatment and randomization. There must be at least 1 SSTR-PET imaging-positive
  measurable site of disease (according to RECIST v1.1) and no RECIST v1.1 measurable
  metastatic lesions that are SSTR imaging-negative.'
- "* Adequate renal function, as evidenced by estimated glomerular filtration rate\

  \ Collaboration \\[CKD-EPI\\]) (Levey et al. 2009)"
- '* Adequate hematologic function, defined by the following laboratory results:'
- "* Part 2: Hemoglobin concentration \u22655.0 mmol/L (\u22658.0 g/dL); ANC \u2265\
  1000 cells/\xB5L (\u22651000 cells/mm3); platelets \u226575 x 109/L (75 x 103/mm3)."
- "* Total bilirubin \u22643 x upper limit normal (ULN)"
- "* Serum albumin \u22653.0 g/dL unless prothrombin time is within the normal range"

- '* Prior radioembolization'
- "* Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association (NYHA)\
  \ Class \u2265II heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<40%\
  \ or QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\>450\
  \ ms for males and \\>470 ms for females."
- '* Resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) \>140/90
  mmHg while on optimal doses of at least 3 antihypertensive medications with 1 being
  a diuretic (Whelton et al. 2018)'

  8%"
- '* PRRT other than Lu-177 SSA'

summary: This study aims to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and recommended
  Phase 3 dose (RP3D) of RYZ101 in Part 1, and the safety, efficacy, and PK of RYZ101
  compared with investigator-selected standard of care (SoC) therapy in Part 2 in
  subjects with inoperable, advanced, well-differentiated, somatostatin receptor expressing
  (SSTR+) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) that have progressed
  following treatment with Lutetium 177-labelled somatostatin analogue (177Lu-SSA)
  therapy, such as 177Lu-DOTATATE or 177Lu-DOTATOC (177Lu-DOTATATE/TOC), or 177Lu-high
  affinity \[HA\]-DOTATATE.
