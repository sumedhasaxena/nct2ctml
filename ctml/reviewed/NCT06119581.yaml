summary: The purpose of this study is to assess if adding LY3537982 (olomorasib) in
  combination with standard of care anti-cancer drugs is more effective than standard
  of care in participants with untreated advanced NSCLC. NSCLC must have a change
  in a gene called KRAS G12C. Study participation, including follow-up, could last
  up to 3 years, depending on how you and your lung cancer are doing.
