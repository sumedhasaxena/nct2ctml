- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Adults of \u2265 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent."
- '* Diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis with generalized muscle weakness, meeting clinical
  criteria for Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Class II to IVa classification.'

  \>= 50 percentage (%) of the total score due to non-ocular symptoms. Screening and
  Baseline MG-ADL scores must be stable. The difference between the Screening and
  Baseline scores should not be more than 2 and there should be no reported MG exacerbation
  during the Screening period'

  any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with parenteral
  anti-infectives within 8 weeks prior or during Screening, or completion of oral
  anti-infectives within 8 weeks prior or during Screening. Vaginal candidiasis, onychomycosis,
  and genital or oral herpes simplex virus considered by the Investigator to be sufficiently

  or zilucoplan within 8 weeks prior to randomization
- Exclude - * History of thymectomy within 6 months prior to Screening.
- Exclude - * History of generalized seizures (except for history of infantile febrile

  Screening should not exceed 50 mg/day for azathioprine, 500 mg/day for mycophenolate
  mofetil, 1 mg/day for tacrolimus, 50 mg/day for cyclosporine, or 7.5 mg/week for
  methotrexate
- Exclude - * Participation in clinical study of any investigational drug within 6
  months, or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug used in the previous clinical
  study prior to randomization, whichever is longer. However, participants with any
  prior exposure to cladribine may not enter the study regardless of timing of exposure

summary: 'The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the efficacy and safety
  of a new oral cladribine formulation in participants with Generalized Myasthenia
  Gravis (gMG) in comparison to placebo. It will also investigate the sustained efficacy,
  the need for retreatment, and the long-term safety of oral cladribine in gMG. An
  additional component is included to characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the
  new cladribine formulation in gMG participants. This study is divided into 3 periods:
  the double-blind placebo control (DBPC) pivotal period, and 2 extensions, the blinded
  extension (BE) and the retreatment (RT) period.'
