prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria :'
- "1. Confirmed diagnosis (per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, unless\
  \ otherwise noted) of one of the following: Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), R/R follicular\
  \ lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small\
  \ lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Waldenstr\xF6m macroglobulinemia (WM), R/R diffuse\
  \ large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or Richter's transformation to DLBCL."
- "2. Participants who have previously received a covalently-binding Bruton\xB4s tyrosine\
  \ kinase (BTK) inhibitor (BTKi) in any line of therapy must have received treatment\
  \ with the BTK inhibitor for \u2265 8 weeks (unless reason for discontinuation is\
  \ intolerance)."
- '3. For dose-finding and dose-expansion, participants who had previously received
  a covalently-binding BTK inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer
  agents are eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria: discontinued
  the previous BTK inhibitor due to disease progression, experienced disease progression
  after completing treatment with a BTK inhibitor or discontinued the BTK inhibitor
  due to toxicity or intolerance.'

- 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2
- "6. Participants enrolling in the dose finding phase of the study may be previously\
  \ treated with a BTKi or may be na\xEFve to BTKi therapy depending on the diagnosis\
  \ and country of enrollment; participants with MCL enrolling in the expansion cohorts\
  \ (Phase 2) must have been treated with a BTKi in a prior line of therapy; CLL/SLL\
  \ participants, in addition to being treated with a BTKi in a prior line of therapy,\
  \ must also have received a Bcl-2 inhibitor in a prior line of therapy as well (Phase\
  \ 2)."

- "Exclude - 1. Prior malignancy (other than the disease under study) within the past\
  \ 2 years, except in situ malignancies that have been curatively resected, localized\
  \ breast cancer treated with curative intent with no evidence of breast active disease\
  \ for more than 3 years and receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy, localized Gleason\
  \ score \u2264 6 prostate cancer undergoing observation or treatment with androgen\

  \ treatment, and in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to recur."
- Exclude - 2. Requires ongoing systemic treatment for any other malignancy
- "Exclude - 3. Requires ongoing systemic (defined as \u2265 10 mg/day of prednisone\
  \ or equivalent) corticosteroid treatment."
- Exclude - 4. Current or history of central nervous system involvement including
  the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (as documented by
  imaging, cytology, or biopsy) by B-cell malignancy, regardless of whether participants
  had received treatment for central nervous system disease
- Exclude - 5. Known active plasma cell neoplasm, prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell
  lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related B-cell
  lymphoma, Castleman disease, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, hairy
  cell leukemia, germinal center B-cell (GCB), DLBCL, EBV+ DLBCL NOS, primary DLBCL
  of the central nervous system (CNS), primary cutaneous DLBCL - leg type, DLBCL associated
  with chronic inflammation, primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular
  large B-cell lymphoma, ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, high-grade
  B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, high-grade B-cell
  lymphoma - NOS, B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between
  DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, or history of or currently suspected transformation
  of an indolent lymphoma to an aggressive histology (except for participants with
  Richter Transformation to DLBCL are eligible for Part 1a, 1c, or Phase 2 and participants
  with history of follicular lymphoma transforming to non-GCB DLBCL who are eligible
  for Part 1a, 1c, or Phase 2).
