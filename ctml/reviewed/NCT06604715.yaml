  Serum monoclonal paraprotein (M-protein) level greater than (\>)0.5 grams per deciliter
  (g/dL); or (b) Urine M-protein level \>200 milligrams per 24 hours (mg/24 hours);
  or (c) Light chain multiple myeloma: serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC)
  \>10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa-lambda
  FLC ratio'
- '* Must have had prior therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory
  agent and anti-CD38 therapy'
- '* Have an eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to

- '* Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), of \> 30 millilitres (mL)/min/1.73
  meter square (m\^2) computed per 2021 chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration
  (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation'
- '* While on study treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment,
  a participant must: (a) Not breastfeed or be pregnant; (b) Not donate gametes (that
  is, eggs or sperm) or freeze for future use for the purposes of assisted reproduction;
  (c) Wear an external condom'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'

- Exclude - * Received a cumulative dose of corticosteroids equivalent to greater
  than or equal to (\>=) 140 mg of prednisone within the 14-day period before the
  start of study treatment administration
- 'Exclude - * Prior antitumor therapy in the specified time frame prior to the first
  dose of study treatment: (Targeted therapy, epigenetic therapy, monoclonal antibody
  treatment, or treatment with an investigational drug or an invasive investigational
  medical device or conventional chemotherapy within 21 days, gene-modified adoptive
  cell therapy or treatment with anti-CD38 directed therapies within 3 months, proteasome

summary: The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose(s)
  (RP2D\[s\]) of JNJ-87562761 in Part 1 (dose escalation), and to determine the safety
  and tolerability at RP2D in Part 2 (dose expansion) in participants with multiple
  myeloma (MM) whose disease has come back after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded
  to treatment (refractory).

      arm_description: Participants will receive JNJ-87562761 during the Part 1 (Dose
        escalation) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen(s). The
        dose will be escalated sequentially until the RP2D regimen(s) have been identified.
        In Part 2 (Dose expansion) participants will receive JNJ-87562761 at the RP2D
        regimen(s) determined in Part 1.
