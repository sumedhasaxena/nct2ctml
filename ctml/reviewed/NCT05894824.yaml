summary: 'This is a Phase Ib/II study to identify the RP2D of T-DXd combination with
  Ram and to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combined treatment in
  advanced gastric cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts: Phase Ib dose
  escalation study to determine the MTD and RP2D of T-DXd combination and Ram, and
  Phase II to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of T-DXd combinations with
  Ram at the RP2D and determine anti-tumor activity.'
