summary: 'Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce
  uncontrollably. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in
  which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. Head and Neck Squamous Cell
  Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the
  tissues of the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events
  and pharmacokinetics of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy and in combination
  with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab,.


  Bevacizumab is an approved product, while Budigalimab and Azirkitug (ABBV-514) are
  investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of NSCLC, HNSCC, and other
  solid tumors. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms.
  The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of Azirkitug (ABBV-514)
  will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different dose of Azirkitug (ABBV-514)
  in monotherapy and in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab. Approximately
  512 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across approximately 80 sites
  worldwide.


  Participants will receive Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy or in combination
  with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab as an Intravenous (IV) Infusion for an estimated
  treatment period of up to 2 years.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical
  assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.'
