summary: 'This study is a multiple cohort, multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study with
  dose-escalation substudies investigating intravenous (IV) BAL0891 as monotherapy,
  and in combination with tislelizumab or paclitaxel, to determine the safety and
  tolerability of increasing doses of BAL0891 in patients with advanced solid tumors
  or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. An adaptive model-based design
  will be used to guide the dose escalation. Subject assignment to Substudy 1, 2,
  3 and 4 will be finalized following approval from the investigator and sponsor.


  The dose-expansion stage will be conducted with the RP2D to further evaluate the
  preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety, and tolerability in metastatic TNBC and
  GC.'
