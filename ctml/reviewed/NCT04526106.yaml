summary: 'This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, FIH study designed to evaluate the safety,
  tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PDy), and antineoplastic
  activity of RLY-4008, a potent and highly selective FGFR2 inhibitor, in patients
  with unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and other solid tumors.
  The study consists of 4 parts: a dose escalation (Part 1), a dose expansion (Part
  2), and an extension (Part 3) and a rollover (Part 4).'
