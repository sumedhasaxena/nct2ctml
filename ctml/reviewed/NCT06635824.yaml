  IV with known subtype).'
- '* Participant has progressed radiographically on or after receiving:'
- '* One prior line of therapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy
  concomitantly) in the metastatic disease setting; OR'
- '* No more than 2 prior lines of therapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based

summary: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, international, Phase 3 trial
  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acasunlimab in combination with pembrolizumab
  versus docetaxel (standard of care) in participants with programmed death ligand
  1 (PD-L1)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been treated
  with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing
  chemotherapy, administered either in combination or sequentially in the metastatic
  setting.
