summary: Open-label, Phase II, randomized, controlled study evaluating the efficacy
  and safety of danvatirsen in combination with pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab
  alone as first-line treatment of patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC.
  Two-thirds of patients will be randomized to receive danvatirsen and pembrolizumab
  and one-third will be randomized to receive pembrolizumab alone.
