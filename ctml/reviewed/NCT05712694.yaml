prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* A subject will be eligible for study participation if he/she meets the following
  criteria:'
- 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, grade 2 or 3, LMS STS that would be
  standardly treated with Gem or GemDoc.
- '2. Determination of LMS subtype: uterine or non-uterine.'
- "3. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (Appendix A), defined as lesions that can\
  \ be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded)\
  \ as \u2265 10 mm with CT scan, as \u2265 20 mm by chest x-ray, or \u2265 10 mm\
  \ with calipers by clinical exam."
- 4. Previous treatment with up to 2 systemic regimens, including at least 1 systemic
  regimen containing doxorubicin.
- 5. Treatment \> one year ago in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting with Gem or Doc
  is allowed.
- 6. Age \>18 years.
- 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \< 1 at enrollment
  (Appendix B).
- "8. Leukocytes \u2265 3,000/mcL."
- "9. Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mcL."
- "10. Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcL."
- "11. Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL"
- "12. Total bilirubin \u2264 2 x ULN. (\u2264 3 x ULN for potential subjects with\
  \ Gilbert's Disease)"
- "13. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 3 x ULN (or \u2264 5 x ULN if liver metastases are\
  \ present)"
- "14. Creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation)."
- "15. Serum uric acid \u2264 8 mg/dL (with or without medication control)."
- 16. QTc interval range from 350 to 450 ms for adult men and from 360 to 460 ms for
  adult women.
- 17. Subjects and their partners must be asked to use appropriate contraception.
  They must agree to use 2 forms of contraception or agree to refrain from intercourse
  for the duration of the study and for 35 days after the last dose of ADI-PEG 20
  or for at least 3 months (male subjects) or 6 months (female subjects) after treatment
  with gemcitabine, whichever is the longer duration.
- 18. Ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent form.
- 19. No concurrent investigational drug studies are allowed.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * A subject will not be eligible for study participation if he/she meets
  any of the exclusion criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent
  second malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin
  cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid
  tumor with no known active disease present in the opinion of the Investigator will
  not affect subject outcome in the setting of current diagnosis.'
- 'Exclude - 2. Currently receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, interferon, radiation
  therapy or other investigational agents. Note: Chemotherapy agent washout period
  is 5 half-lives prior to randomization. Radiation washout period is 7 days prior
  to randomization.'
- Exclude - 3. Prior treatment with ADI-PEG 20, Gem or Doc. Patients treated \> one
  year ago in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting with Gem or Doc are allowed to be enrolled.
- Exclude - 4. Prior pelvic radiation.
- Exclude - 5. Known brain metastases. Such patients must be excluded from this trial
  because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
  dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
- Exclude - 6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical
  or biologic composition to ADI-PEG 20, Gem, Doc, polysorbate 80, pegylated compounds,
  or other agents used in this study.
- Exclude - 7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
  or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
  cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
  with study requirements.
- Exclude - 8. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.
- Exclude - 9. Grade 2 or higher neuropathy.
- Exclude - 10. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must
  have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.
- Exclude - 11. Known HIV-positivity. Because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
  interactions of antiretroviral therapy with the study treatment. In addition, these
  patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
  therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
  antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
- Exclude - 12. Currently receiving other immunosuppressive agents.
- Exclude - 13. Subjects under guardianship, curatorship, under legal protection or
  deprived of liberty by an administrative or judicial decision
