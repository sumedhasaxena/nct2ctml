summary: "This is a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion\
  \ phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of\
  \ HCB101 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with platinum-refractory\
  \ recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. The trial consists of two phases: the dose-escalation\
  \ phase (I) and the dose-expansion phase (II).\n\nSubjects will receive a weekly\
  \ single dose of HCB101 IV infusion over 60 (\xB110) minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15\
  \ in each 21-day cycle in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg IV day 1; given\
  \ every 21 days) until unacceptable AE(s), radiographic or clinically documented\
  \ disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or termination\
  \ of the study whichever occurs first."
