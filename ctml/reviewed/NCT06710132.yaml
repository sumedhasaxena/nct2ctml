summary: 'The PROCEADE PanTumor study aims to investigate M9140 in multiple tumor
  types which express carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5)
  and it is therefore designed as a matrix study. This study aims to assess the antitumor
  activity, tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of M9140 as monotherapy
  or in combination treatments in adult participants with locally advanced/metastatic
  CEACAM5 expressing tumors. There will be 3 substudies under this Master Protocol
  that may be conducted in parallel.
