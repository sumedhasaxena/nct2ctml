  \ ratio (INR) is \u2264 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and partial thromboplastin\
  \ time (PTT) is \u2264 5 seconds above the ULN."

  whose prothrombin time (PT) or PTT is confirmed to be stable for at least 2 weeks.'

summary: 'This clinical trial is designed as a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation,
  dose-expansion, phase 1 clinical trial and will be evaluating the safety and efficacy
  of PB101 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed after standard

  PB101 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and
  modulating the tumor microenvironment.'
