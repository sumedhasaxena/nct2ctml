- '* Resolved acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline severity or Grade 1 in
  accordance with National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for
  Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, except for adverse events (AEs) not constituting a

  factor receptor 2 (HER2) - negative and microsatellite stable (MSS)/proficient mismatch
  repair (pMMR).'

  Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Received \u2265 2 prior systemic anticancer therapies for advanced\

  assessment or imaging, such as prior history or associated symptoms of esophageal
  fistula or T4 classification assessed by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).
- Exclude - * Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency or thymidine synthase
