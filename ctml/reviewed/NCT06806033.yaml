  2 weeks prior to first study treatment

  within 4 weeks prior to first study treatment
- Exclude - * Primary or secondary CNS lymphoma at the time of recruitment or history
  of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma
- Exclude - * Prior CNS involvement that has been definitively treated and confirmed
  via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cerebrospinal fluid analysis to be in complete

  but not limited to, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and
  antitumor necrosis factor agents), within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment
- Exclude - * Ongoing systemic corticosteroid use which, in the opinion of the investigator,
  puts the participant at increased risk of steroid-related iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency

  other than for diagnosis
- Exclude - * Clinically significant history of cirrhotic liver disease
- Exclude - * Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding,
  or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
  that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation

summary: The main goal of this trial is to study the frequency and severity of cytokine
  release syndrome (CRS) in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
  who are using a combination of glofitamab + gemcitabine + oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx)
  followed by glofitamab-only treatment.
