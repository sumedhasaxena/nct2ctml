summary: This study will assess if adding sacituzumab tirumotecan with pembrolizumab
  after surgery is effective in treating NSCLC for participants not achieving pathological
  complete response. The primary hypothesis of this study is sacituzumab tirumotecan
  plus pembrolizumab is superior to pembrolizumab monotherapy with respect to disease
  free survival (DFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).
