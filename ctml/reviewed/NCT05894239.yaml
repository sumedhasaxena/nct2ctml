- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed and documented adenocarcinoma of the
  breast with metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to curative resection'
- '* Confirmation of HER2 biomarker eligibility based on valid results from central

- Exclude - * Prior treatment in the locally advanced or metastatic setting with any
  PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitor or any agent whose mechanism of action is to inhibit
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
- Exclude - * Any prior systemic non-hormonal anti-cancer therapy for locally advanced
  or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer prior to initiation of induction therapy

summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of inavolisib in combination
  with Phesgo (pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and rHuPH20 injection for subcutaneous use)
  compared with placebo in combination with Phesgo, as maintenance therapy, after
  induction therapy in participants with previously untreated HER2-positive advanced
  breast cancer (ABC).
