- '* Age: 1year\~19years of age at diagnosis'
- '* Patients who are newly diagnosed Pre-B ALL and meet one of the following criteria'
- '* High-risk group according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Rome: Age greater
  than or equal to 10 years and less than 19 years at diagnosis, or white blood cell
  count greater than or equal to 50 x 10\^9/L at diagnosis'
- '* If extra-bone marrow lesions are identified at the time of diagnosis, Central
  nervous system involvement (CNS3) or testicular involvement'
- '* High-risk gene variants:'
- KMT2A rearrangement intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)
- "\u25CF If subjects are under the age of 10 at the time of diagnosis and took steroids\
  \ for more than 24 hours within two weeks before the diagnosis, the risk group will\
  \ be determined by the presence of a whole blood test within three days before starting\
  \ steroids. If a whole blood test is performed within three days before beginning\
  \ steroids, the risk group will be assessed based on the white blood cell count\
  \ in the test. If there is no whole blood test before starting steroids, subjects\
  \ are classified as a high-risk group. If subjects are ten or older at diagnosis,\
  \ pre-diagnosis steroid treatment will not affect the risk classification."

- Exclude - * Patients with Down syndrome
