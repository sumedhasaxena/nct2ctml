summary: 'NEEDS is a pragmatic open-label, randomised, controlled, phase III, multicenter
  trial with non-inferiority design with regard to the first co-primary endpoint overall
  survival and superiority for the experimental intervention definitive chemoradiotherapy.
  A second co-primary endpoint is global health related quality of life (HRQOL) one
  year after randomisation. A third co-primary endpoint is eating restictions one
  year after randomisation.


  The aim is to compare outcomes after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with subsequent
  esophagectomy to definitive chemoradiotherapy with surveillance and salvage esophagectomy
  as needed in patients with resectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
  of the esophagus, with the aim to provide generalisable guidance for future clinical
  practice.'
