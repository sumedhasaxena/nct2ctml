summary: The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, LY4052031,
  is safe, tolerable and effective in participants with advanced, or metastatic solid
  tumors including urothelial cancer. The study is conducted in two parts - phase
  Ia (dose-escalation, dose-optimization) and phase Ib (dose-expansion). The study
  will last up to approximately 4 years.
