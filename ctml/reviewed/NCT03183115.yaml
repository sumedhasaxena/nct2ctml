summary: 'Esophageal cancer is a highly lethal disease, and its incidence is still
  increasing in the world. Recent advances in image-enhanced techniques such as Lugol
  chromoendoscopy and narrow band imaging, the number of patients with early esophageal
  squamous cell neoplasias (ESCNs) detected has markedly increased. Endoscopic submucosal
  dissection (ESD) enables en bloc resection of the neoplasia, and the resected specimen
  allows for a pathological assessment to evaluate the curability. However, the patients
  who received complete ESD for early ESCNs frequently developed metachronous recurrence.
  The cumulative metachronous recurrence rate at 5 years was 50%, and the mean annual
  incidence of newly diagnosed metachronous tumors was 10%. Among them, those with
  "speckled" lugol staining pattern over the esophageal background mucosa have the
  highest risk and should be seen as a precancerous lesion of ESCCs. This issue is
  gaining attention in the era of endoscopic treatment, but currently there was no
  appropriate strategy to prevent the tumor recurrence in these high-risk subjects.


  Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a rapidly evolving therapeutic modality,
  and recent studies have shown its efficacy and safety for eradicating for flat type
  early ESCNs. To search a best strategy for the prevention of ESCNs, the investigators
  thus propose a hypothesis that the preemptive RFA for esophageal "speckled" lugol
  background mucosa may prevent the metachronous neoplastic recurrence after complete
  endoscopic resection.'
