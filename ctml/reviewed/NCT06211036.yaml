- 'Inclusion:'
- '* Participant has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study specific
  activities/procedures.'
- '* Age \>= 18 years (or \>= legal adult age within the country if it is older than
  18 years).'
- '* Completed 3-4 cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy with concurrent durvalumab
  as first-line treatment of extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC prior to enrollment, without
  disease progression (ongoing response or stable disease) per Response Evaluation
  Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 1.'
- '* Minimum life expectancy \> 12 weeks.'
- "* Toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy resolved to grade \u2264 1,\
  \ unless otherwise specified, excluding alopecia or fatigue."
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented extensive-stage disease (American
  Joint Committee on Cancer, 2017, IV small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) \[T any, N any,
  M1 a/b/c\]), or T3 to T4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or
  have tumor/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation
  plan. Participants with prior limited-stage (LS)-SCLC are allowed if the interval
  is \> 6 months since the end of previous therapy and progression, in discussion
  with the medical monitor.'
- Exclusion
- '* Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, or leptomeningeal disease.
  Participants with treated brain metastases are eligible as per protocol.'
- '* Prior history of severe or life-threatening events from any immune-mediated therapy.'
- '* History of other malignancy within the past 2 years, with some exceptions as
  per protocol.'
- '* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders as per protocol.'
- '* Myocardial infarction and/or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart
  Association \> class II) within 6 months of first dose of study treatment.'

  6 months of first dose of study treatment.'

- '* History of solid organ transplant.'
- '* Major surgical procedures within 28 days of first dose of study treatment.'
- '* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (participants with HIV infection
  on antiviral therapy and undetectable viral load are permitted with a requirement
  for regular monitoring for reactivation for the duration of treatment on study),
  hepatitis C infection (participants with hepatitis C that achieve a sustained virologic
  response after antiviral therapy are allowed), or hepatitis B infection (participants
  with hepatitis B surface antigen \[HBsAg\] or core antibody that achieve sustained
  virologic response with antiviral therapy are permitted with a requirement for regular
  monitoring for reactivation for the duration of treatment on the study).'
- '* Receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive
  therapy within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.'
- '* History of allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction to antibody
  therapies, platinum chemotherapy, or etoposide.'
- '* Participant with symptoms and/or clinical signs and/or radiographic signs that
  indicate an acute and/or uncontrolled active systemic infection within 7 days prior
  to the first dose of study treatment.'
- '* Participant has known active infection requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment.
  Upon completion of parenteral antibiotics and resolution of symptoms, the participant
  may be considered eligible for the study from an infection standpoint.'
- '* Treatment with live virus, including live-attenuated vaccination, within 4 weeks
  prior to the first dose of study treatment. Inactive vaccines (e.g., non-live or
  non-replicating agent) and live viral non-replicating vaccines (e.g., Jynneos for
  Monkeypox infection) within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.'
- '* Prior therapy with any selective inhibitor of the delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3)
  pathway.'
- '* Receiving another anti-cancer therapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy for resected
  breast cancer is permitted.'

  study as per protocol.'
- '* Female participants planning to become pregnant or donate eggs while on study
  as per protocol.'
- '* Female participants of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test
  assessed at screening by a highly sensitive serum pregnancy test.'
- '* Male participants with a female partner of childbearing potential who are unwilling
  to practice sexual abstinence (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception
  during treatment as per protocol.'
- '* Male participants with a pregnant partner who are unwilling to practice abstinence
  or use a condom during treatment as per protocol.'
- '* Male participants unwilling to abstain from donating sperm during treatment as
  per protocol.'
- '* Participant has known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be
  administered during dosing.'
- '* Participant has known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be
  administered during dosing.'
- '* History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or
  disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or physician if consulted, would
  pose a risk to participant safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures,
  or completion.'
- '* Participant likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study
  visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures (eg, Clinical
  Outcome Assessments) to the best of the participant and investigator''s knowledge.
