summary: The investigational drug, SOA101, is a nanobody-based trispecific antibody
  T cell engager targeting PD-L1/HLA-G/CD3. This is a Phase I/IIa study including
  dose-escalation, dose optimization and dose expansion parts to exam safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics, immunogenecity and efficacy of SOA101 on advanced or metastatic
  solid tumor treatment.
