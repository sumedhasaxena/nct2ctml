- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Participants must meet all the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:'
- "1. Participant is \u2265 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form\
  \ (ICF)."
- 2. Participant is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other
  protocol requirements.
- '3. Participant has been participating in a luspatercept trial and continues to
  fulfill all the requirements of the parent protocol and the participant has been
  either:'
- 1. Assigned to luspatercept treatment, continues to receive clinical benefit in
  the opinion of the investigator and should continue to receive luspatercept treatment,
  OR
- 2. Assigned to placebo arm in the parent protocol (at the time of unblinding or
  in follow-up) and should cross over to luspatercept treatment, OR
- 3. Assigned to the Follow-up Phase of the parent protocol, previously treated with
  luspatercept or placebo in the parent protocol who shall continue into LTPTFU phase
  in the rollover study until the follow-up commitments are met (unless requirements
  are met as per parent protocol to crossover to luspatercept treatment).
- 4. Participant understands and voluntarily signs an informed consent document prior
  to any study-related assessments or procedures being conducted.
- 5. Participant demonstrates compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the
  parent study protocol requirements.
- '6. Applies to on treatment Participants only- females of childbearing potential
  (FCBP) defined as a sexually mature woman who:'
- '1\) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
  bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea
  following cancer therapy or amenorrhea due to other medical reasons does not rule
  out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses
  at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) must:'
- 1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting
  study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of
  the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the participant
  practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.
- 2. Agrees to use, and be able to comply with highly effective, contraception without
  interruption, 35 days prior to starting investigational product (IP), during the
  study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 84 days after discontinuation
  of study therapy.
- '7\. Applies to on treatment participants only- Male participants must:'
- a. Agrees to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female
  of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions
  and for at least 84 days following investigational product discontinuation even
  if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - The presence of any of the following will exclude a participant from
  enrollment:'
- Exclude - 1. Applies to on treatment participants only- Concomitant use of any medications/procedures
  that are prohibited in the parent luspatercept protocol.
- Exclude - 2. Participant has met one or more criteria for study discontinuation
  as stipulated in the parent luspatercept protocol.
- Exclude - 3. Applies to on treatment participants only- More than 26 days between
  last luspatercept dose in the parent protocol and first dose into ACE-536-LTFU-001
  protocol unless dose delay or dose discontinuation criteria met.
- Exclude - 4. Applies to on treatment participants only- Pregnant or breastfeeding
  females.
- Exclude - 5. Participant has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality,
  psychiatric illness, or is considered vulnerable by local regulations (eg, imprisoned
  or institutionalized) that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.
- Exclude - 6. Participant has any condition including the presence of laboratory
  abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate
  in the study.
- Exclude - 7. Participant has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret
  data from the study.

summary: "A Phase 3b, open-label, single-arm, rollover study to evaluate the long-term\
  \ safety of luspatercept, to the following participants:\n\n* Participants receiving\
  \ luspatercept on a parent protocol at the time of their transition to the rollover\
  \ study, who tolerate the protocol-prescribed regimen in the parent trial and, in\
  \ the opinion of the investigator, may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment\
  \ with luspatercept\n* Participants in the follow-up phase previously treated with\
  \ luspatercept or placebo in the parent protocol will continue into long-term post-treatment\
  \ follow-up in the rollover study until the follow-up commitments are met\n* The\
  \ study design is divided into the Transition Phase, Treatment Phase and Follow-up\
  \ Phase. Participants will enter transition phase and depending on their background\
  \ will enter either the treatment phase or the Long-term Post-treatment Follow-up\
  \ (LTPTFU) phase\n* Transition Phase is defined as one Enrollment visit\n* Treatment\
  \ Phase: For participants in luspatercept treatment the dose and schedule of luspatercept\
  \ in this study will be the same as the last dose and schedule in the parent luspatercept\
  \ study. This does not apply to participants that are in long-term follow-up from\
  \ the parent protocol\n* Follow-up Phase includes:\n\n  \\- 42 Day Safety Follow-up\
  \ Visit\n* During the Safety Follow up, the participants will be followed for 42\
  \ days after the last dose of luspatercept, for the assessment of safety-related\
  \ parameters and adverse event (AE) reporting\n\n  \\- Long-term Post-treatment\
  \ Follow-up (LTPTFU) Phase\n* Participants will be followed for overall survival\
  \ every 6 months for at least 5 years from first dose of luspatercept in the parent\
  \ protocol, or 3 years of post-treatment from last dose, whichever occurs later,\
  \ or until death, withdrawal of consent, study termination, or until a subject is\
  \ lost to follow-up. Participants will also be monitored for progression to AML\
  \ or any malignancies/pre-malignancies. New anticancer or disease related therapies\
  \ should be collected at the same time schedule\n\nParticipants transitioning from\
  \ a parent luspatercept study in post-treatment follow-up (safety or LTPTFU) will\
  \ continue from the same equivalent point in this rollover study.\n\nThe ACE-536-LTFU-001\
  \ rollover study will be terminated, and relevant participants will discontinue\
  \ from the study when all participants fulfill 5 years on the study, including treatment\
  \ and follow-up."
