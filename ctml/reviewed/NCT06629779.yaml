prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
  small cell features.'
- '* Metastatic disease in bone documented on bone scan, or in soft tissue documented
  on CT/MRI scan.'
- '* Progressive disease in the setting of medical or surgical castration.'
- "* ECOG performance status 0 or 1, with a life expectancy of \u226512 months as\
  \ assessed by the investigator."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Any medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past
  year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that make the
  participant inappropriate for the study.
- Exclude - * Known history of active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, chronic
  diarrhea, or previous gastric resection or lap-band surgery.
- Exclude - * Clinically significant cardiovascular disease.
- Exclude - * Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease
  or clinically significant history of seizure.
- Exclude - * Any history of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or
  any other prior malignancy with a few exceptions.
- "Exclude - * Participants must be treatment na\xEFve at the mCRPC stage, eg, no\
  \ cytotoxic chemotherapy, radio-ligand therapy (i.e. 177Lu- PSMA-617), CDK4/6 inhibitors,\
  \ 5-alpha reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer in any setting, androgen receptor\
  \ signaling inhibitors (ARSi) including enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide,\
  \ poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) monotherapy or other systemic anti-cancer treatment\
  \ with the following exceptions:"
- Exclude - 1. Treatment with first-generation antiandrogen (ADT) agents;
- Exclude - 2. Docetaxel treatment is allowed for mCSPC, as long as no signs of failure,
  or disease progression occurred during treatment or within 3 months of treatment
  completion.
- Exclude - * Previous administration with an investigational product (drug or vaccine)
  within 30 days or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study intervention (whichever
  is longer).
- Exclude - * Inadequate organ function.

summary: "This study will explore whether a combination of the investigational drug\
  \ PF-06821497 and enzalutamide will work better than taking enzalutamide alone in\
  \ participants with mCRPC who are ARSi or abiraterone na\xEFve."
