  of cervical cancer.
- Exclude - 2. Evidence of metastatic disease.
- Exclude - 3. Intent to administer a fertility-sparing treatment regimen.
- Exclude - 4. History of organ transplant or allogenic stem cell transplant.
- Exclude - 5. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.
- Exclude - 6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.
- "Exclude - 7. History of another primary malignancy except for a) Malignancy treated\
  \ with curative intent with no known active disease \u22652 years before the first\
  \ dose of study intervention; b) Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo\
  \ maligna, or carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease."
- Exclude - 8. Unresolved toxicities from previous CCRT except for irreversible toxicity
  that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated.

  before the first dose of the study intervention is excluded. The following are exceptions
  to this criterion: a) Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections
  (eg, intraarticular injection); b) Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity
  reactions (eg, CT scan premedication or chemotherapy premedication) or a single
  dose for palliative purpose (eg, pain control).'
- Exclude - 12. Patients who have undergone a previous hysterectomy, including a supracervical
  hysterectomy, or will have a hysterectomy as part of their initial cervical cancer
  therapy.
- Exclude - 13. Any prior (besides prior CCRT) or concurrent treatment for cervical
  cancer.
- Exclude - 14. Major surgical procedures within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
  the study intervention or still recovering from prior surgery.
- Exclude - 15. Exposure to immune mediated therapy prior to the study for any indication.
- Exclude - 16. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first
  dose of the study intervention.
- Exclude - 17. Participants with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the study
  intervention, or any excipients of the study intervention.

summary: This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center,
  global study to explore the efficacy and safety of volrustomig in women with high-risk
  LACC (FIGO 2018 stage IIIA to IVA cervical cancer) who have not progressed following
  platinum-based CCRT.
