summary: This is a 2-arm, randomized, open-label, multicenter, global, Phase 3 trial
  to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tovorafenib monotherapy versus
  standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy in participants with pediatric low-grade glioma
  (LGG) harboring an activating rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) alteration
  requiring first-line systemic therapy.
