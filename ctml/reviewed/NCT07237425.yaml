  inclusive.'

  cardiac, renal, hepatic, pulmonary or other systemic disease, significant medical
  or psychiatric condition, known seropositivity to HIV/HBV/HCV, or clinically significant
  laboratory findings that would, in the investigator's judgment, make the subject
  inappropriate for the study.

- Exclude - 9. Administration of a COVID-19 vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.
- 'Exclude - 10. Abnormal hepatic and renal functions; hematologic changes at screening:'

- Exclude - 12. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not likely to
  complete the trial for whatever reason.
- 'Exclude - Part I \& Part II Ronkyla Plus cohort specific exclusion criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. History of any medical condition contraindicated or not recommended
  for aspirin use including active peptic ulcer disease, asthma, gout, uncontrolled
  hypertension.
- Exclude - 2. Taking any medication contraindicated or not recommended for concomitant
  use with aspirin within 7 days prior to enrollment.
- Exclude - 3. Allergic to Aspirin, salicylates, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs (NSAIDs).
- Exclude - 4. The target lipoma warrants surgical removal per the investigator's
  judgement (e.g., for confirming its pathology).
- 'Exclude - Part I dose level 2 and 4 cohorts \& Part II specific exclusion criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the past year prior to Day
  1.
- Exclude - 2. History of smoking or use of nicotine-containing product within 6 months

summary: This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of
  Ronkyla Plus, a combinational drug that forms a hydrogel at the injection site,
  promising a better experience of lipolysis injection for the treatment of superficial
  lipoma. The study consists of a Part I dose-escalation study to investigate the
  drug's maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for this indication and a Part II study for
  evaluating its relative bioavailability in comparison to an FDA-approved lipolysis
  injection, Kybella.
