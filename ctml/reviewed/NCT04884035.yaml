summary: 'This is a Phase 1b study consisting of 2 parts: a dose escalation (Part
  1) of CC-220 or CC-99282 added to the standard R-CHOP-21 regimen for first-line
  treatment of a-BCL. The dose escalation (Part 1) will consist of 2 parallel arms
  in combination with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone
  (R-CHOP-21); CC-220 and R-CHOP-21 or CC-99282 and R-CHOP-21. Part 1 will be followed
  by a randomized dose expansion (Part 2) with CC-220 and/or CC-99282 at the Recommended
  Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in combination with R-CHOP-21. A polatuzumab-R-CHP regimen in
  combination with CC-220 or CC-99282 will be explored with the addition of a new
  cohort only after the RP2D for the CC-220 and/or CC-99282 and R-CHOP-21 combination
  has been defined.'
