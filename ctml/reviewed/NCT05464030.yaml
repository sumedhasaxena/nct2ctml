- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participants with documented histopathological diagnosis of locally advanced
  or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), who were intolerant/refractory to or progressed
  after standard systemic therapies for the advanced/metastatic stage, if locally
  indicated and available to the participant. Participants with a known microsatellite
  instability high (MSI-H) status must have received treatment with an immune checkpoint
  inhibitor (if locally indicated and available) unless contraindicated.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) below or equal
  to 1'
- '* Participants with adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function as defined
  in protocol'
- '* Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Participant has a history of malignancy within 3 years before the date
  of enrollment (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and
  carcinoma in situ of the cervix, benign prostate neoplasm/hypertropia, or malignancy
  that in the opinion of the Investigator, with concurrence with the Sponsor's Medical
  Monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years)
- 'Exclude - * Participants with known brain metastases, except those meeting the
  following criteria: Brain metastases that have been treated locally and are clinically
  stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment; No ongoing neurological
  symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the disease (sequelae that
  are a consequence of the treatment of the brain metastases are acceptable)'
- Exclude - * Participants with diarrhea (liquid stool) or ileus Grade \> 1
- Exclude - * Participants with active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative
  colitis, Crohn's disease, intestinal perforation) and/or bowel obstruction
- Exclude - * Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (New
  York Heart Association \[NYHA\] \>= II) or a coronary revascularization procedure
  within 180 days of study entry. Calculated QTc average (using the Fridericia correction
  calculation) of \> 470 milliseconds (ms)
- Exclude - * Cerebrovascular accident/stroke (\< 6 months prior to enrollment)
- Exclude - * Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply

summary: 'The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical activity of M9140 in advanced solid tumors.
  This study contains 2 parts: Dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).


  Study details include:


  * Study Duration per participant: Approximately 4 months for Part 1 and 8 months
  for Part 2

  * M9140 is not available through an expanded access program'
