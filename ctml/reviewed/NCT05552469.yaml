prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1\\. Patients must be \u2265 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed\
  \ consent form (ICF) 2. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\
  \ status (PS) \u2264 2 3. Patient must be a candidate for serial bone marrow aspirate\
  \ and/or biopsy according to the institutions guidelines and must be willing to\
  \ undergo a bone marrow aspirate."
- '4\. Patients must have one of the following for eligibility into the study:'
- '1. In dose optimization: IPSS-R defined very low, low or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic
  Syndrome (LR MDS) who failed to respond to or did not tolerate ESAs or luspatercept
  or HMAs and patients with del 5q who failed to respond to or did not tolerate lenalidomide;
  or'
- '2. In dose optimization and expansion: IPSS-R defined very low, low or intermediate
  risk Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (LR CMML) who failed to respond to or did not
  tolerate hydroxyurea or HMAs.'
- '3. changes for dose expansion (applicable as of amendment 3):'
- "1. LR MDS with \u2264 10% bone marrow blasts, IPSS-R score of \u2264 3.5, transfusion\
  \ independent (TID) status as per IWG 2006 criteria (requiring \\<4U pRBC in 8 weeks),\
  \ clinically meaningful cytopenia(s) and no or limited (\\<4 months) prior therapy\
  \ for MDS."
- 2. LR CMML patients with symptomatic cytopenias and/or constitutional symptoms refractory,
  intolerant or unsuitable for standard first-line therapy.
- '3. HR-CCUS: Diagnosis of high-risk CCUS by clonal hematopoiesis risk score (CHRS)
  with clinically meaningful cytopenias and no prior therapy for a myeloid neoplasm.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1\. Systemic antineoplastic therapy (including cytotoxic chemotherapy,
  alpha-interferon, kinase inhibitors or other targeted small molecules, and toxin-immunoconjugates)
  or any experimental therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
  and recovered from the toxicities before the first dose of study treatment. For
  patients that received antibodies the washout period is 4 weeks prior to study treatment.
- 'Exclude - a. For TID LR MDS in Dose Expansion Phase only (applicable as of amendment
  03):'
- "Exclude - 1. Prior therapy for MDS administered for \\>4 months (ESA and luspatercept\
  \ administered for \u22644 months will be allowed if washout period followed)"
- Exclude - 2. Concurrent malignancy requiring active systemic therapy
- Exclude - 3. Prior or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for MDS at any time
- Exclude - 2\. History of hypersensitivity to the study treatment or its excipients
  or to drugs of similar chemical classes.
- Exclude - 3\. Patients who have previously been treated with agents that have the
  same mechanism of action as DFV890 as defined in Table 6-7, list of prohibited medications
  (e.g., drugs targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and the IL-1 pathway (canakinumab
  and anakinra)).
- "Exclude - 4\\. Use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g., G-CSF,\
  \ GM-CSF, M-CSF), thrombopoietin mimetics or erythroid stimulating agents anytime\
  \ \u2264 1 week (or 5 half lives, whichever is longer) prior to start of study treatment."
- 'Exclude - 5\. Patients receiving:'
- Exclude - a. concomitant medications that are known to be modulators of cytochrome
  P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and/or CYP3A (specifically strong or moderate inducers of CYP2C9,
  strong inducers of CYP3A enzymes, strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 and/or strong or moderate
  dual inhibitors of CYP2C9/CYP3A); and b. patients, who are poor CYP2C9 metabolizers
  receiving concomitant medications known to be strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A,
  whose concomitant medications cannot be discontinued or switched to a different
  medication within 5 half-lives or 1 week (whichever is longer) prior to start of
  study treatment and for duration of the study. See Section 6.8 and list of prohibited
  drugs in Appendix 8 for more details.
- 'Exclude - 6\. Dose expansion only: Poor CYP2C9 metabolizers defined as genotype
  of the CYP2C9 \*3/\*3 or CYP2C9 \*2/\*3 allele combinations are excluded.'
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: 'Study CDFV890G12101 is an open-label, phase 1b, multicenter study with a
  randomized two-dose optimization part, and a dose expansion part consisting of three
  groups evaluating DFV890 in patients with myeloid diseases. The purpose of this
  study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
  efficacy and recommended dose for single agent DFV890 in patients with lower risk
  (LR: very low, low or intermediate risk) myelodysplastic syndromes (LR MDS), lower
  risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (LR CMML) and High-Risk Clonal Cytopenia of
  Undetermined Significance (HR CCUS).'
