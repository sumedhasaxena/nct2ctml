- 9\. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding females.
- Exclude - 2. Subjects have received anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy,
  radiotherapy, hormonal or any investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives
  (whichever is shorter) or immunotherapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of
  study treatment.
- Exclude - 3. Subjects have received strong or moderated cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
  inhibitors or CYP inducers such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, netupitant, isavuconazole
  etc. within 5 half-lives or 7 days (whichever is the shortest) prior to the first

  \ have HBsAg (+) with HBV DNA \u2265 1000 IU/mL, or anti-HCV Ab (+) with HCV RNA\
  \ (+). If a patient with HBsAg (+) then HBV DNA needs to be tested. If a patient\

  \ alopecia and hot flashes) related to previous treatment."
- Exclude - 9. Subjects have baseline QTcF interval \> 450 msec at screening (within
  28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, mean of triplicate readings

  \ of cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment."
- Exclude - 11. Subjects have undergone any major surgery within 3 weeks prior to
  the first dose of study treatment.
- "Exclude - 12. Subjects with known active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal\
  \ metastases. Subjects with previously-treated brain or meningeal metastases may\
  \ participate and be eligible for treatment provided they are stable and asymptomatic\
  \ (without evidence of progression by imaging of the brain at least 4 weeks prior\
  \ to the first dose of study treatment), and are not using excessive steroids (defined\
  \ as a prednisolone dose \u2264 10 mg daily or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks\
  \ prior to the first dose of study treatment."
- 'Exclude - 13. Subjects have had any of the following within 6 months prior to the
  first dose of study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris,
  coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular

summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is To establish the safety profile and determine
  the dose-limited toxicity (DLT) of PEP07 monotherapy in patients with advanced or
  metastatic solid tumors. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
  Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEP07 monotherapy.


  Participants will receive PEP07 administered orally once daily (QD) for 2 consecutive
  days and 5 days off, every week for 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable
  toxicity, confirmed pregnancy, death, consent withdrawal, or other anti-cancer treatment
  is required, or the Sponsor ends the study, whichever occurs first.'

      arm_description: "The dose escalation stage of PEP07 monotherapy consists of\
        \ an accelerated dose escalation followed by a standard \"3+3\" dose escalation.\
        \ The accelerated titration will enroll 1 patient in each dose cohort until\
        \ 1 patient experiences a DLT or a total of 2 patients experience any \u2265\
        \ grade 2 PEP07-related AE during Cycle 1, and then the dose escalation will\
        \ be switched to the 3+3 scheme to enroll 3 to 6 patients at the dose cohort\
        \ where the DLT or the second \u2265 grade 2 PEP07-related AE is observed.\n\
        \nTo confirm the safety and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of PEP07, expansion\
        \ cohorts with 12 patients will be opened for PEP07 monotherapy at RP2D once\
        \ efficacy signal is observed in the dose escalation."
