summary: This is a Phase 3, 2-arm, randomized, open-label, global, multicenter study
  comparing the efficacy of ripretinib to sunitinib in participants with GIST who
  progressed on first-line treatment with imatinib, harbor co-occurring KIT exons
  11+17/18 mutations, and are without KIT exon 9, 13, or 14 mutations. Upon disease
  progression as determined by an independent radiologic review, participants randomized
  to sunitinib will be given the option to either crossover to receive ripretinib
  150 mg QD or discontinue sunitinib.
