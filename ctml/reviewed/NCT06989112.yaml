prior_treatment_requirements:
- '* Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Participants must be \u2265 18 years of age at the time of screening. Other age\
  \ restrictions may apply as per local regulations."
- '* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial endometrial carcinoma. All histologies
  are allowed except for sarcomas (carcinosarcomas are allowed).'
- '* Following surgery or diagnostic biopsy, participant must have primary advanced
  disease (Stage III/IV) or first recurrent endometrial cancer and meet at least one
  of the following criteria:'
- '* Primary Stage III (per FIGO 2023) disease with measurable disease at baseline
  per RECIST 1.1 based on the investigator''s assessment.'
- '* Primary Stage IV disease (per FIGO 2023) regardless of presence of measurable
  disease at baseline.'
- '* First recurrent disease regardless of presence of measurable disease at baseline.'
- '* Endometrial cancer with HER2 IHC expression of 3+ or 2+ as assessed by prospective
  central testing.'
- '* Endometrial cancer that is determined pMMR by prospective central IHC testing.'
- '* Provision of adequate FFPE tumor tissue sample of a tumor lesion that was not
  previously irradiated for central HER2, MMR, and PD-L1 IHC testing and valid central
  test results for randomization/ stratification.'
- '* Prior therapy:'
- "* Na\xEFve to first-line systemic anticancer therapy. Participants may have received\
  \ one prior line of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy with curative intent (chemotherapy\
  \ or chemoradiation) if disease recurrence or progression occurred \u2265 6 months\
  \ after last dose of chemotherapy. Prior trastuzumab in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant\
  \ setting is allowed."
- '* No prior exposure to ADCs or immune checkpoint inhibitors including (but not
  limited to) anti-PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and therapeutic anticancer
  vaccines.'
- '* Participants may have received prior radiation therapy for the treatment of endometrial
  cancer. Prior radiation therapy may have included pelvic radiation therapy, extended
  field pelvic/para-aortic radiation therapy, and/or intravaginal brachytherapy. Adequate
  treatment washout period is required.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1.'
- "* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50% within 28 days before randomization."
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function within 14 days before randomization.'
- 'Exclude - * Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * History of organ transplant
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to ongoing
  or active known infection, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated
  with diarrhea and active non-infectious skin disease requiring systemic treatment.
- Exclude - * Spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system
  metastases
- Exclude - * Participants with a medical history of myocardial infarction (MI) within
  6 months before randomization, or symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA
  Class II to IV), clinically significant arrhythmia, or cardiomyopathy of any etiology.
  Participants with troponin levels above ULN at screening (as defined by the manufacturer),
  should have a cardiologic consultation before enrollment to rule out MI
- Exclude - * History of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids,
  current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by
  imaging at screening.
- 'Exclude - * Lung criteria:'
- Exclude - * Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including,
  but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (e.g., pulmonary emboli within
  3 months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion etc.).
- Exclude - * Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders where there
  is documented, or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement at the time of screening.
- Exclude - * Prior pneumonectomy (complete).
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring
  chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.
- 'Exclude - * Active primary immunodeficiency/ active infectious disease(s) including:'
- Exclude - * Tuberculosis (TB)
- Exclude - * HIV infection that is not well controlled.
- Exclude - * Chronic or active hepatitis B, chronic or active hepatitis C; however,
  participants who have chronic hepatitis B and are receiving suppressive antiviral
  therapy are allowed to be enrolled if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is normal and
  viral load is controlled.
- Exclude - * Any concurrent anticancer treatment without an adequate washout period
  prior to the first dose of study intervention. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy
  for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g., HRT) is allowed.

summary: DESTINY-Endometrial01 will investigate the efficacy of first-line T-DXd +

  (carboplatin + paclitaxel) + pembrolizumab (Arm C), by assessment of progression

  3+/2+), pMMR, primary advanced (Stage III/IV) or recurrent EC.

        the discretion of the investigator, participants may continue to receive carboplatin,

        as an alternative to paclitaxel for participants who had a hypersensitivity
        reaction to paclitaxel with a failed rechallenge (or not amenable to rechallenge),
        according to the investigator's clinical judgment.
