  to standard therapy or have no accepted standard therapy.
- 3. Solid tumors that are measurable or evaluable as per Response Evaluation Criteria
  in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Target lesions that have been previously irradiated
  will not be considered measurable (lesion).

- "6. QTcF \u2264 470 ms at screening."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in
  the study:'
- Exclude - 1. Clinically significant comorbidity such as unstable angina, congestive
  heart failure (NYHA Grade III or IV), uncontrolled hypertension (\>160/100 mmHg
  despite optimal medical treatment), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  with frequent exacerbations, refractory asthma, inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal
  obstruction.
- Exclude - 2. Acute myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within
  6 months prior the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 3. Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis or seizure disorder due to
  underlying malignancy except those who have been treated and have stable CNS metastases
  or are asymptomatic.
- Exclude - 4. AIDS-defining opportunistic infections within the past 12 months.
- Exclude - 5. HBV infection (positive HBsAg) except for carrier of inactive HBV as
  defined by negative HBeAg with normal ALT and HBV DNA \< 2,000 IU/mL or HCV infection
  (positive anti-HCV antibody) except for those with undetectable HCV RNA.
- 'Exclude - 6. Inadequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic or renal function as defined
  by any of the following laboratory values:'
- "Exclude - 1. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\< 1500/\xB5L"
- "Exclude - 2. platelet count \\< 100 x 10\\^9 /\xB5L"
- Exclude - 3. hemoglobin \< 9 g/dL
- Exclude - 4. total bilirubin \> 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)
- Exclude - 5. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
  \> 3 x ULN if no hepatic metastases are present; \> 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases
  are present
- Exclude - 6. Estimated (Cockroft-Gault formula) creatinine clearance (CrCl) \< 60
  mL/min CrCl = \[(140 - age (year)) x weight (kg)\] / (serum creatinine x 72) (x
  0.85 for females)
- "Exclude - 7. Toxicities resulting from prior therapy or surgical procedures not\
  \ yet resolved to \u2264 NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade 1 with the exception of alopecia,\
  \ skin hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation."
- Exclude - 8. Major surgical procedures (as defined by Investigator) within 4 weeks
  prior to the first dose of study drug or any ongoing post-operative complications.
- Exclude - 9. Receiving any (investigational or approved) anti-cancer therapy (including
  chemotherapy or targeted therapy) within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
  prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 10. A history of apparent allergic reactions to irinotecan, Tween 80 (dosed
  with prior treatment with prophylactic drug), and/or ethanol.
- Exclude - 11. If female, is pregnant or breastfeeding.
- Exclude - 12. If men or women with childbearing potential, unwilling to use effective
  contraceptive methods during the study and for at least 3 months (men) or 1 month
  (women) after the last dose of study drug. Effective contraceptive methods include
  implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs),
  sexual abstinence, surgical sterilization or a partner who is sterile.
- Exclude - 13. Receiving live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first
  dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 14. Life expectancy \< 3 months
- Exclude - 15. Other prior or ongoing condition(s) that, in Investigator's opinion,
  could affect the safety of the subject, compromise the subject's ability to comply
  with the study requirements or impair the assessment of study results.

summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of T-1201 injection in subjects
  with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for whom no standard
  therapy is available. The main questions it aims to answer are:


  * The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T-1201 on different dosing schedules.

  * The Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of T-1201 on different dosing schedules.


  Researchers will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary
  efficacy of T-1201.


  Participants will:


  Received T-1201 either once every 4 (Part A)/2 (Part B)/3 (Part C) weeks, depend
  on they participate in which parts of study.


  Visit the clinic once every 2/3 weeks for checkups and tests'
