summary: 'The purpose of this clinical trial (called the FLOTILLA study) is to give
  continued access to the study medicines, as well as safety follow-up, for participants
  in prior clinical trials of encorafenib and/or binimetinib.


  All participants who took part in earlier encorafenib and/or binimetinib studies
  may participate the FLOTILLA study if they are still benefiting from the use of
  the study medicines. This will be determined by the study doctor. People may not
  participate in the FLOTILLA study if they have not enrolled in a prior study of
  encorafenib or binimetinib.


  Participants that had enrolled but had stopped receiving the study treatment in
  a prior study cannot enrolled in this study. Participants in the FLOTILLA study
  will receive encorafenib and/or binimetinib at the same dose and frequency as in
  their prior study, for up to about 5 years.'
