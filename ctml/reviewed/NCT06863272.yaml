summary: 'The purpose of this substudy is to assess the efficacy and safety of ifinatamab
  deruxtecan (I-DXd), given alone or with other treatments in participants with metastatic
  castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The goals of this study are to learn
  about:


  * The safety of the study treatment and if people tolerate it.

  * A safe dose level of I-DXd that can be used with other treatments.

  * Participant levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) during treatment.'
