prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally
  advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer
- 2. Adult females, pre- and/or post-menopausal, and adult males. Pre-menopausal (and
  peri-menopausal) women can be enrolled if amenable to treatment with an LHRH agonist.
  Patients are to have commenced concomitant treatment with LHRH agonist prior to
  or on Cycle 1, Day 1 and must be willing to continue for the duration of the study.
- 3. Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. Female subjects
  who are not surgically sterile must use a medically effective contraceptive method
  from screening until 2 years after the last dose of study treatment.
- 4. Progression of disease during or within 12 months of completing (neo)adjuvant
  ET.
- 5. Adequate archival, fresh tumor tissue, or liquid biopsy for the analysis of PIK3CA
  mutational status.
- '6. Permitted prior therapies:'
- 1. (neo)adjuvant fulvestrant or any selective ER degrader only if the treatment
  duration \< 6 months
- 2. (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy
- 3. (neo)adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitor, unless PD was on or within 6 months of discontinuation
  of CDK4/6i
- 7. Subject has radiologically measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1, per local
  assessment. Patients with evaluable bone-only disease are not eligible. Patients
  with bone-only disease that has lytic or mixed lytic/blastic lesions and at least
  one measurable soft tissue component per RECIST v1.1 may be eligible.
- 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.
- 9. Life expectancy of at least \>6 months.
- 10. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, renal and coagulation function.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Concurrent malignancies other than adequately treated non-melanoma
  skin cancer. Previous malignancies in remission but curatively treated with no evidence
  of disease progression and judged by local Investigator to be at low risk of impacting
  health or survival while on study.
- Exclude - 2. Prior treatment with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor,
  a protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor, or a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  inhibitor
- Exclude - 3. Prior treatment with systemic anticancer therapy for ABC
- Exclude - 4. Subjects with type 1 diabetes
- Exclude - 5. Known and untreated, or active, brain or leptomeningeal metastases
- Exclude - 6. History of clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities
- Exclude - 7. History of drug-induced symptomatic interstitial lung disease (pneumonitis)
  or hepatitis
