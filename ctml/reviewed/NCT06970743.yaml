summary: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BGB-16673
  compared with investigator's choice (bendamustine plus rituximab or high-dose methylprednisolone
  plus rituximab) in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) previously exposed to covalent
  Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) (cBTKi).
