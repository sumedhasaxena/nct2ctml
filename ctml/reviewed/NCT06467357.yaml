prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Male and female patients must be at least 18 years of age at the time of signing
  the informed consent. Other age restrictions may apply as per local regulations.'
- '* Unresectable, previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract
  adenocarcinoma. Prior treatment in the perioperative and/or adjuvant setting is
  permissible provided there is \> 3 months (90 days) between the end of adjuvant
  treatment and the diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic disease.'
- '* Histologically confirmed HER2-expressing (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) BTC.'
- '* Patients must provide an FFPE tumor sample that is no older than 3 years for
  tissue-based IHC staining to centrally determine HER2 expression, PD-L1 status,
  and other correlatives.'
- '* Has at least one target lesion assessed by the Investigator based on RECIST v1.1.
  (Randomized portion only)'
- '* WHO/ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 with no deterioration over the previous
  2 weeks prior to baseline or day of first dosing.'
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function within 14 days before randomization.'
- '* Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative serum pregnancy test for females
  of childbearing potential.'
- '* Minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Prior exposure to other HER2 targeting therapies, ADCs, immune checkpoint
  inhibitors and therapeutic anticancer vaccines.
- Exclude - * Histologically confirmed ampullary carcinoma.
- Exclude - * Any other medical conditions such as clinically significant cardiac
  or psychological conditions, that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere
  with the patient's participation in the clinical study or evaluation of the clinical
  study results.
- Exclude - * Spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system
  metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with corticosteroids
  or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms.
- Exclude - * Medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization/enrollment,
  symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II to IV),
  unstable angina pectoris, clinically important cardiac arrhythmias, or a recent
  (\< 6 months) cardiovascular event including stroke.
- Exclude - * Serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea
  (eg, active inflammatory bowel disease); active non-infectious skin disease (including
  any grade rash, urticaria, dermatitis, ulceration, or psoriasis) requiring systemic
  treatment.
- Exclude - * Active autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders that
  has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years, or where there is documented,
  or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement at the time of screening.
- Exclude - * Corrected QT interval (QTcF) prolongation to \> 470 msec (females) or
  \> 450 msec (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead ECG.
- Exclude - * History of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis, has current ILD/pneumonitis,
  or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.
- Exclude - * Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including,
  but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (eg, pulmonary emboli within
  three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion etc).
- Exclude - * Prior pneumonectomy (complete).
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals.
  Patients with prior cholangitis/biliary tract infections/biliary intervention (eg,
  stent, external drain) should have completed a full course of antibiotics prior
  to randomization.
- Exclude - * Active primary immunodeficiency, known uncontrolled active HIV infection
  or HCV.
- Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated
  with curative intent with no known active disease within 3 years before the first
  dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence. Exceptions
  include adequately resected nonmelanoma skin cancer and curatively treated in situ
  disease. For certain participant populations, exceptions could also include carcinomas
  in-situ or Ta tumors treated with curative intent.
- Exclude - * Pleural effusion, ascites or pericardial effusion that requires drainage,
  peritoneal shunt, or Cell-free and Concentrated Ascites Reinfusion Therapy (Drainage
  and Cell free and Concentrated Ascites Reinfusion Therapy are not allowed within
  2 weeks prior to screening assessment).
- Exclude - * Any concurrent anticancer treatment without an adequate washout period
  prior to randomization. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer related
  conditions (eg, hormone replacement therapy) is allowed.
- Exclude - * History of organ transplants or allogenic stem cell transplant.
