summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with proficient mismatch
  repair (pMMR) endometrial cancer (EC) that is advanced or recurrent.


  * EC is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues inside the uterus (womb)

  * pMMR indicates that certain normal proteins are present in the cancer cells

  * Advanced means the cancer has spread locally or to other parts of the body (metastatic)
  and cannot be removed with surgery

  * Recurrent means the cancer came back after surgery


  Sacituzumab tirumotecan (also known as sac-TMT) and pembrolizumab are the study
  medicines. Sac-TMT is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to specific
  targets on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.


  The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive sac-TMT with pembrolizumab
  live longer and without the cancer getting worse compared to people who receive
  pembrolizumab alone.'
