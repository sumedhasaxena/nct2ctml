summary: This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, phase 2 study of trastuzumab,
  bevacizumab, and paclitaxel as second-line treatment for patients with HER2-positive
  advanced gastric cancer who had progressed on first-line chemotherapy including
  trastuzumab or anti-HER2 agents.

      arm_description: This is a single arm study. Trastuzumab has been administered
        at 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks after initial loading of 8 mg/kg during the first
        anticancer treatment, so in the second anticancer treatment, 4 mg/kg is administered
        every 2 weeks to maintain the same concentration. Bevacizumab is administered
        at 5 mg/kg at 2-weekly intervals used in metastatic colorectal cancer. Paclitaxel
        is administered on a standard schedule of 80 mg/m2 for 3 consecutive weeks
        followed by a 1-week break as an existing weekly regimen, and when side effects
        occur, the weekly dose is reduced by 25% to 60 mg/m2 for 3 weeks or administered
        every 2 weeks. Administer 80 mg/m2. Administration of this drug is set as
        one cycle of 4 weeks.
