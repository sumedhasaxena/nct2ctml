prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Male or female patients, 20 years of age or older at the time of consent.
- 2. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of esophageal cancer (including
  squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) whose postneoadjuvant pathologic stage
  is ypT1-4 AND ypN1-3 according to the AJCC Cancer Staging System, 8th Edition.
- 3. Patients have been treated with preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy
  followed by esophagectomy with lymph node dissection for locally advanced esophageal
  cancer (defined by the above criterion).
- '4. Postneoadjuvant pathologic staging: ypT1-4 and ypN1-3.'
- "5. Globo H IHC H-score \u22651 in the surgical tumor specimen from the primary\
  \ site/or lymph node (if the primary site is not available). The Globo H expression\
  \ will be determined by a qualified laboratory."
- 6. R0 (no residual tumor on the surgical margin of the resected tumor specimen).
- 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
- '8. Organ Function Requirements - Subjects must have adequate organ functions as
  defined below:'
- "* AST/ALT \u2264 3X ULN (upper limit of normal)"
- "* Total bilirubin \u2264 2X ULN"
- "* Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5X ULN"
- "* ANC \u2267 1,500 /\u03BCL"
- "* Platelets \u2267 100,000/\u03BCL"
- 9. All eligible patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraception
  during study treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose of OBI-833/OBI-821.
  Subjects not of childbearing potential (i.e., permanently sterilized, postmenopausal)
  can be included in the study. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months with no menses
  without an alternative medical cause.
- 10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
  document according to institutional guidelines.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Subjects who cannot be randomized within 8 weeks after the esophageal
  cancer surgery.
- Exclude - 2. Subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding at entry.
- Exclude - 3. Subjects with splenectomy.
- Exclude - 4. Has prior malignancy, except (a) adequately treated basal cell or squamous
  cell skin cancer; (b) in situ cervical cancer; (c) previously diagnosed malignancy
  which has been adequately treated and shown no evidence of recurrence for more than
  5 years.
- Exclude - 5. Subjects with HIV infection, active hepatitis B infection, or active
  hepatitis C infection.
- Exclude - 6. Subjects with any autoimmune or other disorders requiring IV/oral steroids
  or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.
- Exclude - \- e.g., type 1 juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, antibody positive for
  rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, lupus, scleroderma,
  systemic vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, immune mediated thrombocytopenia, Crohn disease,
  ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis.
- Exclude - 7. Subjects with any known uncontrolled comorbid illness, including ongoing
  or active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA\>2), unstable angina
  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
  limit compliance with study requirements.
- 'Exclude - 8. Subjects who have received any of the following medications within
  4 weeks prior to randomization:'
- Exclude - * Immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, interferons,
  and checkpoint inhibitors.
- Exclude - * Immunosuppressants, including cyclosporin, rapamycin, tacrolimus, rituximab,
  alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and cyclophosphamide.
- Exclude - * Other biologics, including G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors.
- Exclude - * Live attenuated vaccines.
- Exclude - * IV/oral steroids except single prophylactic use in CT/MRI scan or other
  one-time use in approved indications. Use of inhaled and topical (except on the
  injection site) steroids is allowed.
- Exclude - * Alternative and complementary medicine that may affect the immune system.
- Exclude - * Other investigational drugs
- Exclude - 9. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having
  not resolved to Grade 0 or 1 (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
  Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] version 5.0), except for alopecia and
  laboratory values listed in the inclusion criteria.
- Exclude - 10. Subjects with any known severe allergies (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any
  active or inactive ingredients in the study drugs.
- Exclude - 11. Any other reason that the investigator deems the patient as unsuitable
  for the study.
