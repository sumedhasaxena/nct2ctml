- '* Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
  version 1.1.'
- '* Documented diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), biliary tract cancers (BTC), squamous
  cell carcinoma of the esophagus, (ESCC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone
  receptor+/HER2-breast cancer (HR+/HER2-BC), head and neck squamous-cell-carcinoma
  (HNSCC), or Platinum Resistant High Grade Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (PROC)/primary
  peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer (by World Health Organization \[WHO\] criteria).
  Participant meets the criteria for disease activity laid out in the protocol.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
  immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives
  of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of ABBV-400. Palliative
  radiation therapy for bone, skin, or subcutaneous metastases with 10 fractions or
  less is permitted and not subject to a washout period.
- Exclude - * Unresolved clinically significant AEs \> Grade 1 from prior anticancer
  therapy.
- Exclude - * History of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis that required
  treatment with systemic steroids, or any evidence of active ILD or pneumonitis,
  including but not limited to those listed in the protocol.
- Exclude - * History of clinically significant, intercurrent lung-specific illnesses,
  including those laid out in the protocol.
- Exclude - * Untreated brain or meningeal metastases (i.e., participants with history
  of metastases are eligible provided they do not require ongoing steroid treatment
  for cerebral edema and have shown clinical and radiographic stability for at least
  14 days after definitive therapy). Participants may continue on antiepileptic therapy
  if required.
- Exclude - * History of other active malignancy, with the exception of those laid
  out in the protocol.
- Exclude - * Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with documented
  or suspicious pulmonary involvement at screening (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's,
  sarcoidosis etc.), and prior pneumonectomy.

summary: 'Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce
  uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change
  in disease activity when ABBV-400 is given to adult participants to treat advanced
  solid tumors.


  ABBV-400 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of advanced
  solid tumors. Study doctors put the participants in groups called cohorts. Cohorts
  1-8 receive ABBV-400 alone (monotherapy) followed by a safety follow-up period.
  Cohort 9 receives ABBV-400 in combination with a strong CYP3A3 inhibitor (ITZ) followed
  by a safety follow-up period. Approximately 285 adult participants with hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), biliary tract cancers
  (BTC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), triple negative breast cancer
  (TNBC), hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-)
  breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive \[HR+\]/HER2-breast cancer \[BC\]), head
  and neck squamous-cell-carcinoma (HNSCC), Platinum Resistant High Grade Epithelial
  Ovarian Cancer (PROC)/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, or advanced solid
  tumors, will be enrolled in the study in approximately 54 sites worldwide.


  In cohorts 1-8, participants with the following advanced solid tumor indications:
  HCC, PDAC, BTC, ESCC, TNBC, HR+/HER2-BC, HNSCC, and PROC/primary peritoneal/fallopian
  tube cancer will receive intravenous (IV) ABBV-400 monotherapy and in cohort 9 participants
  will receive intravenous (IV) ABBV-400 and an oral solution of ITZ, for up to 3
  years during and up to the treatment period with an additional safety follow-up
  period of up to 2 years.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
