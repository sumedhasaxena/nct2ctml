prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Explicit and voluntary consent to participation in the trial obtained by signing
  and dating a consent form that clearly and completely describes the purpose, potential
  risks, and other important issues related to the trial.
- '2. Sex: female'
- '3. Age (at the time of informed consent): 20 years and older'
- 4. Subjects with histologically-or cytologically-confirmed endometrial cancer or
  carcinosarcoma(Mixed Mullerian Tumor)
- '5. Clinical stage: Stage I - IIIC2 and surgically completely resectable'
- 6. No evidence of distant metastases
- 7. MMRd or MSI-H subtype (defined by either deficient/loss expression of mismatch
  repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 or microsatellite instability-high
  (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction assay for 5 microsatellite markers)
- 8. ECOG Performance Status Score 0 or 1
- 9. Patients with a life expectancy of at least 3 months
- 10. Patients whose latest laboratory data meet the below criteria within 7 days
  before first dose. If the date of the laboratory tests at the time of enrollment
  is not within 7 days before the first dose of the investigational product, testing
  must be repeated within 7 days before the first dose of the investigational product,
  and these latest laboratory tests must meet the following criteria. Of note, laboratory
  data will not be valid if the patient has received a granulocyte colony-stimulating
  factor (G CSF) or blood transfusion within 14 days before testing.
- "* White blood cells \u22652,000/mm3 and neutrophils \u22651,500/mm3"
- "* Platelets \u2265100,000/mm3"
- "* Hemoglobin \u22659.0 g/dL"
- "* AST (GOT) and ALT (GPT) \u22643.0-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the\
  \ study site (or \u22645.0-fold the ULN of the study site in patients with liver\
  \ metastases)"
- "* Total bilirubin \u22641.5-fold the ULN of the study site"
- "* Creatinine \u22641.5-fold the ULN of the study site or creatinine clearance (either\
  \ the measured or estimated value using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) \\>45 mL/min"
- 11. Women of childbearing potential (including women with chemical menopause or
  no menstruation for other medical reasons)#1 must agree to use contraception#2 from
  the time of informed consent until 5months or more after the last dose of the investigational
  product. Also, women must agree not to breastfeed from the time of informed consent
  until 5 months or more after the last dose of the investigational product.
- "* Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women after the onset of menstruation\
  \ who are not postmenopausal and have not been surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy,\
  \ bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy). Post-menopause is defined as\
  \ amenorrhea for \u226512 consecutive months without specific reasons. Women using\
  \ oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or mechanical contraception such as\
  \ contraceptive barriers are regarded as having childbearing potential."
- '* The subject must consent to use any one of the following methods of contraception:
  a condom for the subject''s partner (male), an intrauterine device (IUD) for female
  subjects, or skin implantation of a rod contraceptive (Implanon).'
- '* Complete sexual abstinence is also acceptable: Sexual abstinence is considered
  highly effective only if it is defined as abstaining from sexual intercourse with
  the opposite sex for the entire duration of the trial treatment-related risks. The
  reliability of sexual abstinence in relation to the duration of the trial needs
  to be evaluated, and sexual abstinence should be a preferred and routine lifestyle
  of the subjects.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Patients with multiple primary cancers (with the exception of completely
  resected basal cell carcinoma, stage I squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ,
  intramucosal carcinoma, or superficial bladder cancer, or any other cancer that
  has not recurred for at least 5 years)
- Exclude - 2. Patients with residual adverse effects of prior therapy or effects
  of surgery that would affect the safety evaluation of the investigational product
  in the opinion of the investigator or sub-investigator.

  any other antibody products
- Exclude - 4. Patients with concurrent autoimmune disease or history of chronic or
  recurrent autoimmune disease
