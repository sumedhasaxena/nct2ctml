- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'BCG-unresponsive Patients:'
- '1. BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without coexisting
  papillary Ta/T1 tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy,
  and have experienced CIS disease within 12 months of treatment where: adequate BCG
  regimen consists of at least 2 courses of BCG where the first course (induction)
  must have included at least 5 or 6 doses and the second course may have included
  a re-induction (at least 2 treatments) or maintenance (at least 2 doses), and Cis
  must be documented or indicated by pathology'
- 'Phase 2 Only:'
- "2. BCG-Na\xEFve or BCG-incompletely treated Patients with CIS or BCG-unresponsive,\
  \ HG Ta/T1 papillary disease without CIS:"
- '-NMIBC with current Cis of the bladder, with or without coexisting papillary Ta/T1
  NMIBC tumor(s), who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy,
  where: either: cohort 2a) no treatment with BCG but may have previously been treated
  with at least 1 dose of intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection
  of bladder tumor (TURBT) and Cis must be documented or cohort 2b) indicated by pathology
  incomplete BCG treatment (at least 1 dose and less than the 5+2 doses required for
  adequate dosing per Cohort 1) or cohort 3) patients who are BCG-unresponsive following
  adequate treatment, with HG Ta/T1 papillary disease without CIS.'
- 'All Patients:'
- 3. Patients who have previously been treated with a checkpoint inhibitor and failed
  treatment are eligible for inclusion 30 days post-treatment (Phase 1) or 3 months
  post-treatment (Phase 2).
- 4. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female, 18 years or older.
- 5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening.
- 6. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using
  highly effective birth control methods; Male patients are required to utilize a
  condom for the duration of the study treatment through 3 months post-dose.
- 7. In Phase 2, for patients with T1 lesions may be eligible after repeat TURBT if
  pathology shows non-invasive (Ta or less) or no disease.
- '8. Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0, 1, and 2.'
- '9. Hematologic inclusion: a. Absolute neutrophil count \>1,500/mm3. b. Hemoglobin
  \>9.0 g/dL. c. Platelet count \>100,000/mm3.'
- "10. Hepatic inclusion: a. Total bilirubin must be \u22641.5 x the upper limit of\
  \ normal (ULN). b. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\
  \ and alkaline phosphatase \u22642.5 x ULN."
- 11. Adequate renal function with creatinine clearance \>30 mL/min
- "12. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time \u22641.25 x ULN or within\
  \ the therapeutic range if on anticoagulation therapy."
- 13. Must have satisfactory bladder function with ability to retain study drug for
  60 minutes.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Active malignancies (i.e., progressing or requiring treatment change
  in the last 24 months). Exceptions allowed under Sponsor review.
- Exclude - 2. Concurrent treatment with any chemotherapeutic agent.
- Exclude - 3. History of partial cystectomy.
- Exclude - 4. Treatment with last therapeutic agent (including intravesical chemotherapy
  post-TURBT) within 30 days of Screening (prior to the screening biopsy).
- Exclude - 5. Patients who have received systemic immunosuppressive medication including
  high-dose corticosteroids.
- Exclude - 6. History of severe asthma or other respiratory diseases.
- Exclude - 7. History of unresolved vesicoureteral reflux or an indwelling urinary
  stent.
- Exclude - 8. History of unresolved hydronephrosis due to ureteral obstruction.
- Exclude - 9. Participation in any other research protocol involving administration
  of an investigational agent within 30 Days prior to screening or any prior treatment
  of NMIBC with any investigational gene or immunotherapy agent.
- Exclude - 10. History of external beam radiation to the pelvis or prostate brachytherapy
  within the last 12 months.
- Exclude - 11. History of interstitial lung disease and/or pneumonitis in patients
  who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.
- Exclude - 12. Evidence of metastatic disease.
- Exclude - 13. History of difficult catheterization that in the opinion of the Investigator
  will prevent administration of EG-70.
- Exclude - 14. Active interstitial cystitis on cystoscopy or biopsy.
- Exclude - 15. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring
  systemic therapy.
- Exclude - 16. Known human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection.

summary: "This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravesical administration\
  \ of EG-70 in the bladder and its effect on bladder tumors in patients with NMIBC.\n\
  \nThis study study consists of two phases; a Phase 1 dose-escalation to establish\
  \ safety and recommended the phase 2 dose, followed by a Phase 2 study to establish\
  \ how effective the treatment is.\n\nThe Study will include patients with NMIBC\
  \ with Cis for whom BCG therapy is unresponsive and patients with NMIBC with Cis\
  \ who are BCG-na\xEFve or inadequately treated."
