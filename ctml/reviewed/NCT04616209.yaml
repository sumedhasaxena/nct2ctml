- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Recipient:'
- 1. Recipients (Subjects) are between 20-70 years of age.
- "2. Related donor: 6/6 matched at HLA-A, -B and -DRb1 or haploidentical donor \u2265\
  \ 4/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRb1"
- 3. Signed informed consent.
- 4. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed non -small-cell lung
  cancer of stage IIIB-IV, not amenable to definitive multi-modality therapy, or recurrent
  disease after a prior diagnosis of stage I-III disease. All staging is determined
  via the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/IASLC 8th edition proposed staging
  criteria.

- 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.
- 7. Lifespan over 6 months.
- '8. Acceptable organ function, as evidenced by the following laboratory data:'
- "\uFF08a\uFF09 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\
  \ \u2264 3.0 \xD7 upper limit of normal (ULN). (for patients with known hepatic\
  \ metastases, AST and/or ALT \u2264 5\xD7 ULN) \uFF08b\uFF09 Total serum bilirubin\

- Donor
- 1. Donors are between 20-65 years of age.
- "2. Related donor: 6/6 matched at HLA-A, -B and -DRb1 or haploidentical donor \u2265\
  \ 4/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRb1"
- 3. Signed informed consent.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Recipient:'
- Exclude - 1. Patients with history of clinically significant interstitial lung disease
  or radiation pneumonitis.
- Exclude - 2. Patients with brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
- Exclude - 3. Patients who have had radiation to the lung fields within four weeks
  of starting treatment. For all palliative radiation to all other sites, at least
  7 days must have elapsed prior to starting to treatment.
- "Exclude - 4. Patients who have had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal,\
  \ or intra-pelvic) within two weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not\
  \ recovered from side effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery\
  \ (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can\
  \ be enrolled in the study \u22651 week after the procedure."
- Exclude - 5. Patients who received anti-cancer treatment and did not recover from
  toxicities to grades 0-1 by NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) are not eligible but WBC and
  Hgb Grade 2 is acceptable.
- Exclude - 6. Patients with a second, clinically active, cancer. Patients with second
  cancers that have been treated with curative intent and/or are currently inactive
  are allowed.
- Exclude - 7. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity.
- Exclude - 8. Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients
  previously treated with investigational agents must complete a washout period of
  at least one week or five half-lives, whichever is longer, before starting treatment.
- Exclude - 9. Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents or chronic
  corticosteroid use, except those on topical or inhaled steroids, or steroids are
  given via local injection.
- "Exclude - 10. Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular\
  \ disease, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior\
  \ to screening, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF \\<50%), cardiac\
  \ arrhythmia not controlled with medication, uncontrolled hypertension defined as\
  \ an SBP \u2265 160mm Hg and/or DBP \u2265 100mm Hg, with or without anti-hypertensive\
  \ medication. Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is allowed\
  \ prior to screening."
- Exclude - 11. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection requiring
  IV antimicrobials for management.
- Exclude - 12. Pregnancy and lactating women.
- Exclude - 13. Other situations the investigators think not eligible for participation
  in the research.
- Exclude - Donor
- Exclude - 1. Donors who are pregnant and lactating women.
- Exclude - 2. Donor who has had advanced tumor diseases.
- Exclude - 3. Donor who has had autoimmune diseases.
- Exclude - 4. Donors are positive for one of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
  syphilis serology test (RPR+TPHA), CMV IgM, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), and
  hepatitis B and C virus.
- Exclude - 5. Other situations the investigators think not eligible for participation
  in the research.
