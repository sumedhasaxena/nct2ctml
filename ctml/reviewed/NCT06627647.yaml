prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented non-squamous NSCLC.'
- '* Stage IV mNSCLC (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer Edition 8) not
  amenable to curative treatment.'
- '* Absence of sensitizing EGFR mutations (including, but not limited to, exon 19
  deletion and exon 21 L858R, exon 21 L861Q, exon 18 G719X, and exon 20 S768I mutations)
  and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.'
- '* Absence of documented tumor genomic mutation results from tests conducted as
  part of standard local practice in any other actionable driver oncogenes for which
  there are locally approved targeted 1L therapies.'
- "* Provision of acceptable tumor sample, to confirm tumor PD-L1 expression TC \u2265\
  \ 1%."
- "* At least one lesion not previously irradiated that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1\
  \ TL at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the\
  \ longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm)\
  \ with CT or MRI and is suitable for accurate repeated measurements."
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Presence of small cell and neuroendocrine histology components.
- Exclude - * Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not requiring steroids
  or anticonvulsants for at least 7 days prior to randomization. A minimum of 2 weeks
  must have elapsed between the end of local therapy (brain radiotherapy or surgery)
  and randomization. Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effect
  of radiotherapy (eg, dizziness and signs of increased intracranial pressure) or
  surgery prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Any prior systemic therapy received for advanced or mNSCLC. Prior systemic
  therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and/or definitive radio- or chemoradiotherapy
  for early-stage disease are allowed, provided that recurrence or progression has
  occurred \> 12 months after the end of treatment.
- Exclude - * Any prior exposure to an anti-TIGIT therapy or any other anticancer
  therapy targeting immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms.
- Exclude - * Any prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent.
- "Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated\
  \ with curative intent with no known active disease \u2265 2 years before the first\
  \ dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence."
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring
  chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.
- Exclude - * Active primary immunodeficiency/active infectious disease(s).
- Exclude - * Active tuberculosis infection.

summary: The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung03 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
  rilvegostomig compared to pembrolizumab, both in combination with platinum-based
  doublet chemotherapy, as a first-line treatment of patients with non-squamous mNSCLC
  whose tumors express PD-L1.
