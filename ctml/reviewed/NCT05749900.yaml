summary: 'Biliary tract cancer is a rare malignant neoplasm including intrahepatic
  cholangiocarcinoma (IhCCA), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EhCCA) and Gallbladder
  cancer (GBC). Survival outcome of advanced BTCs are still poor and heterogeneity
  of tissue and molecular differences between BTCs limit the clinical studies in BTCs.


  Combination therapy of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin has become the standard of care
  after the ABC-02 trial. This trial demonstrated that the addition of cisplatin to
  gemcitabine improved survival outcomes compared to that with gemcitabine alone.
  However, the median overall survival (OS) of Gem/Cis chemotherapy is only about
  one year.


  Anti-Program cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) inhibitor monotherapy including Nivolumab
  (OPDIVO) had shown efficacy in refractory, advanced BTC. Various ICIs combined with
  Gem/Cis as the 1st line treatment in BTCs are under the trials. Combination of Nivolumab
  and Gem/Cis showed improved overall survival (15.4 months) in a small sized study
  (n=30) with tolerable side effects in advanced BTC patients. Recently reported interim
  analysis of phase III TOPAZ-1 trial (NCT03875235) showed Durvalumab, anti-PD-L1
  agent, combined with Gem/Cis showed improvement of overall survival. Considering
  other studies currently ongoing, ICIs combined with Gem/Cis are thought to be the
  future standard of care in 1st line treatment of advanced stage BTCs.


  HER2 amplification/overexpression is presented as many as 15% of total BTC patients.
  Basket trial of administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab combination in previously
  treated HER2 positive advanced BTC patients showed promising overall response rate
  of 23%. Also, multicenter phase II study conducted by Korean investigators (KCSG-HB19-14)
  showed promising effect of Trastuzumab combined with modified FOLFOX in Gem/Cis
  refractory HER2 positive BTC patients with ORR of 29.4%. Moreover, preclinical data
  showed synergistic anti-cancer effect of trastuzumab combined with ICIs in HER2
  positive cancers. Similar data are reported in HER2 positive gastric cancer that
  phase II and phase III clinical data showed 1st-line ICIs combined with trastuzumab
  and cytotoxic chemotherapy showed promising overall survival outcomes.


  In treating HER2-positive advanced BTC, the triple combination of nivolumab, trastuzumab,
  and cytotoxic chemotherapy (Gem/Cis) may overcome innate resistance and activate
  an immune response to cancer along with inhibiting oncogenic signal from HER2 pathway,
  resulting in a synergistic effect with a longer response.'
