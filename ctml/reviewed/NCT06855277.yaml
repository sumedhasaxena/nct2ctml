prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study.'
- "* Participants must be adults \u2265 18 years of age."
- '* Participants must have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.'
- '* Participants must have histological, and/or cytological confirmation of adenocarcinoma
  of the prostate. Participants with mixed histology (neuroendocrine) are not eligible.'
- '* Participants who have received taxane-based chemotherapy in mHSPC setting are
  eligible if they are deemed appropriate for chemotherapy or ARPI change as the next
  line of therapy in the opinion of the Investigator. Note: Participants who have
  received taxane-based chemotherapy for mCRPC are excluded.'
- '* Participants must not have received taxane-based chemotherapy in mCRPC setting
  (allowed in mHSPC setting).'
- '* Participants must have PSMA-PET positive disease using a PSMA imaging agent that
  is approved as per protocol.'
- '* Participant must have been diagnosed with mCRPC with documented progressive disease
  while on treatment with ARPI in mHSPC or earlier setting as their last treatment
  (and did not progress on more than one ARPI).'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with any approved or investigational RLT, approved
  or investigational radioisotopes
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with any conventional external beam radiotherapy
  including hemi-body radiation within 6 weeks of randomization (within 2 weeks for
  radiotherapy of localized metastases).
- Exclude - * Participants with known or suspected deleterious germline or somatic
  homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant
  prostate cancer.
- Exclude - * Any approved or investigational agents/systemic anti-cancer therapy
  (e.g. other chemotherapy, investigational therapy, immunotherapy or biological therapy
  including monoclonal antibodies) within 28 days (or 5 times the half-life of that
  therapy whichever is longer) of the anticipated day C1D1.
- Exclude - * Diagnosed with other active malignancies that are expected to alter
  life expectancy or may interfere with disease assessment.
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether \[225Ac\]Ac-PSMA-617 (AAA817),
  given for up to 6 cycles at a dose of 10 Megabecquerel (MBq) +/- 10%, plus androgen
  receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI), improves the radiographic progression free survival
  (rPFS) compared to investigator's choice of standard of care (SOC) (ARPI change
  or taxane-based chemotherapy) in adult participants with PSMA-positive metastatic
  castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with another ARPI as last treatment
  and who have not been exposed to a taxane-containing chemotherapy in the mCRPC setting
  nor have received any prior PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy.
