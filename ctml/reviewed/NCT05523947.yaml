        patients are assigned to receive YH32367 at a starting dose and the dose being

        Dose Expansion Part: 2 Cohorts (Cohort 1: Biliary tract cancer, Cohort 2:
        Solid tumors). Dose Expansion part will consist of multiple cohorts in patients
        who were treated with at least 1 prior gemcitabine- and/or cisplatin-based
        therapy, HER2 positive biliary tract cancer(Cohort 1); in patients who were
        treated with all available standard therapies and have no available options,
        HER2 positive solid tumor malignancies other than breast and gastric or gastroesophageal
        junction adenocarcinoma and biliary tract cancer(Cohort 2).'
