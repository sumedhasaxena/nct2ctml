summary: In the preoperative waiting area, the patients are randomly assigned and
  divided into two groups according to the allocation sequence table (corresponding
  to 1:1 randomization) generated by the computer. The propofol group was both induced
  and maintained at an effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.0-4.0 mcg/mL by a target-controlled
  infusion (TCI) system. The sevoflurane group was maintained via sevoflurane vaporizer
  between 1% and 3% (target minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7-1.3). The following
  patient data were recorded, the type of anesthesia, sex, age at the time of surgery,
  preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and functional capacity, the
  postoperative complications within 30 days (according Clavien-Dindo classification),
  American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) physical status scores, tumor size, intraoperative
  blood loss/transfusion, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, total opioid
  (remifentanil/fentanyl/ propofol) use, postoperative radiation therapy, postoperative
  chemotherapy, postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the presence of disease
  progression, and 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year overall survival and Karnofsky performance
  status score were recorded.
