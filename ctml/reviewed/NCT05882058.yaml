  specimens are not allowed: Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), Cytology samples, decalcified
  bone samples.'
- 7. Adequate organ function as defined in the protocol.

  ready and able to use acceptable methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result
  in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
  A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria and instructions on the duration
  of their use is provided in the participant information
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- '1. Untreated or symptomatic brain metastases. (Part 2: with mandatory assessment
  by brain MRI within 21 days before first trial drug administration.) Participants
  with treated, stable brain metastases are eligible provided they meet the following
  criteria:'
- '* Radiotherapy or surgery for brain metastases was completed at least 2 weeks prior
  to the first administration of BI 764532.'
- '* Patient is off steroids for at least 7 days (physiologic doses of steroids are
  permitted), and the patient is off anti-epileptic drugs for at least 7 days or on
  stable doses of anti-epileptic drugs for malignant central nervous system (CNS)
  disease.'

  history of therapy-related pneumonitis that is considered clinically resolved are
  eligible.'
- 4. Participants who experienced severe, life-threatening immune-mediated adverse
  events or infusion-related reactions including those that lead to permanent discontinuation
  while on treatment with immuno-oncology agents.
- '5. Prior anti-cancer therapy:'
- '* Patients who have been treated with any other anti-cancer drug within 4 weeks
  or within 5 half-life periods (whichever is shorter) prior to first administration
  of BI 764532.'
- '* Patients who have been treated with extensive field radiotherapy including whole
  brain irradiation within 2 weeks prior to first administration of BI 764532.'
- 6. Previous treatment with Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3)-targeting T cell engagers
  or cell therapies.
- 7. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or systemic steroid therapy or any other form of
  immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of BI 764532. Physiological
  replacement of steroids is allowed.
- 8. Unresolved toxicity from prior anti-tumour therapy, defined as per protocol.

summary: "This study is open to adults with small cell lung cancer and other neuroendocrine\
  \ tumours. The study is in people with advanced cancer for whom previous treatment\
  \ was not successful or no standard treatment exists.\n\nThe purpose of this study\
  \ is to find a suitable dose of BI 764532 that people with advanced cancer can tolerate.\
  \ 2 different doses of BI 764532 are tested in this study. Another purpose is to\
  \ check whether BI 764532 can make tumours shrink. BI 764532 is an antibody-like\
  \ molecule (DLL3/CD3 bispecific) that may help the immune system fight cancer.\n\
  \nThe study has 2 parts. In Part 1, participants are put into 2 groups randomly,\
  \ which means by chance. Participants have an equal chance of being in either group.\
  \ One group gets dose 1 of BI 764532 and the other group gets dose 2 of BI 764532.\
  \ In Part 2, all participants receive the same dose of BI 764532. Part 2 is open\
  \ to people with a certain kind of tumour called extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\
  \nAll participants receive BI 764532 as an infusion into a vein when starting treatment.\
  \ If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment\
  \ is given up to the maximum duration of the study. During this time, participants\
  \ visit the study site regularly. The total number of visits depends on how they\
  \ respond to and tolerate the treatment.\n\nThe first study visits include an overnight\
  \ stay to monitor participants\xB4 safety. Doctors record any unwanted effects and\
  \ regularly check the general health of the participants."
