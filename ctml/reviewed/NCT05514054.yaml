- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have any evidence of metastatic disease (including contralateral ALN)
  or inflammatory breast cancer at primary breast cancer diagnosis.
- Exclude - * Participants with more than a 6-month consecutive gap in therapy during
  the course of prior adjuvant ET.
- Exclude - * Participants who have completed or discontinued prior adjuvant ET \>6
  months prior to screening.
- "Exclude - * Participants with a history of previous breast cancer are excluded,\

  5 years ago."
- Exclude - * Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children
  within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through
  180 days after the last dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Participant has previously received ET of any duration for breast cancer
  prevention (tamoxifen or AIs) or raloxifene.
- Exclude - * Participants with a history of any other cancer.
- Exclude - * Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of

summary: The main purpose of this study is to measure how well imlunestrant works
  compared to standard hormone therapy in participants with early breast cancer that
  is estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal receptor 2 negative (HER2-).
  Participants must have already taken endocrine therapy for two to five years and
  must have a higher-than-average risk for their cancer to return. Study participation
  could last up to 10 years.
