summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat types of breast cancer that
  are both:


  * High-risk, which means the cancer may have a higher chance of getting worse or
  coming back after treatment

  * Early-stage, which means the cancer is in the breast or the lymph nodes around
  the breast The 2 types of breast cancer in this study are triple-negative breast
  cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR)-low positive/human epidermal growth factor
  receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. These cancers have zero or a low amount
  of a protein called HER2 and other proteins that attach to the hormones estrogen
  or progesterone.


  Sacituzumab tirumotecan (also known as sac-TMT or MK-2870), the study medicine,
  is a type of targeted therapy. A targeted therapy is a treatment that works to control
  how specific types of cancer cells grow and spread.


  The main goals of this study are to learn if people who receive sac-TMT, pembrolizumab,
  and chemotherapy:


  * Have fewer cancer cells found in the tumors and lymph nodes removed during surgery
  compared to those who receive only pembrolizumab and chemotherapy

  * Live longer without the cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to
  people who receive only pembrolizumab with chemotherapy'

      arm_description: Participants receive sacituzumab tirumotecan intravenously
        (IV) at a dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) + IV pembrolizumab 200 mg every
        3 weeks (Q3W), for 12 weeks; then receive IV pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W and
        IV carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 1.5 + IV paclitaxel 80 mg/m\^2 once
        weekly, for 12 weeks. 3-6 weeks later, participants undergo surgery and optional
        radiation therapy, and receive IV pembrolizumab 400 mg once every 6 weeks
        or 200 mg Q3W for up to approximately 28 weeks. Additional adjuvant treatment
        of physician's choice (TPC) may be administered to participants with residual
        disease. TPC options are olaparib 300 mg oral twice daily (BID) for 1 year
        (participants with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutation (gBRCAm)
        only); capecitabine 1000-1250 mg/m\^2 oral twice daily on days 1-14 and 22-35
        each cycle for 4 six-week cycles; or doxorubicin 60mg/m\^2 (or epirubicin
        90 mg/m\^2) IV infusion Q3W/Q2W + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m\^2 IV infusion
        Q3W/Q2W for 4 doses.
