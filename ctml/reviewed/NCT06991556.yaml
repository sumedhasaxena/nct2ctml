- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) \u22642"
- '* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Participants with mixed
  histology (neuroendocrine) are not eligible'
- "* High-volume mHSPC, defined by the presence of \u22651 metastatic visceral non-nodal\
  \ lesion and/or \u22654 metastatic bone lesions (with at least one lesion outside\
  \ the vertebral column and/or pelvis) in imaging exams (CT/MRI or bone scan) according\
  \ to local radiology assessment by the investigator obtained \u226428 days prior\
  \ to randomization"
- "* Participants must have a castrate level of serum/plasma testosterone (\\<50 ng/dL\
  \ or \\<1.7 nmol/L). Ongoing ADT (as defined by prior orchiectomy and/or ongoing\
  \ GnRH analog/antagonist) for \u226490 days is allowed prior to randomization, provided\
  \ that PSA zero (PSA level \\<0.2 ng/ml according to local laboratory as assessed\
  \ by the investigator) is not achieved prior to randomization."
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Prior exposure to a second generation ARPI (such as enzalutamide/darolutamide/apalutamide\
  \ and/or abiraterone) for the treatment of advanced/metastatic disease is not allowed.\
  \ Prior exposure to ARPI, to taxane chemotherapy (up to 6 cycles) or to RLT in the\
  \ context of (neo)adjuvant treatment for localized prostate cancer is allowed, if\
  \ the last dose of this treatment was administered \\>12 months from randomization.\
  \ Prior use of a first generation ARPI (such as bicalutamide) in the context of\
  \ ADT initiation with a GnRH analog is allowed, provided the first generation ARPI\
  \ was administered for \u226414 days and last dose was administered \u22657 days\
  \ from randomization."
- Exclude - * Participants with biochemical recurrence only or those without evidence
  of metastatic disease by radiological imaging (CT/MRI or bone scan) are not eligible
- Exclude - Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: This Phase II study aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of the combination
  of JSB462 (also known as luxdegalutamide) at 100 mg and 300 mg once a day (QD) doses
  + abiraterone compared with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI, abiraterone
  or enzalutamide) in participants with metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer
  (mHSPC) and to select the recommended dose of the combination for phase III. Towards
  that end, the totality of the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK data from participants
  randomized in the study will be evaluated
