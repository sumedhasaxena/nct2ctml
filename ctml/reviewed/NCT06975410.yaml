summary: This is a study for people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer for
  whom previous treatment was not successful. Adults aged 18 and over with advanced
  cancer with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) overexpressing can join the
  study. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called YH32364
  helps people with locally advanced or metastatic cancers with EGFR overexpression.

        assess the safety and tolerability of YH32364 and to identify the Maximum
        Tolerated dose (MTD) and/or two dose levels for recommended dose (RD) selection.


        Dose Expansion Part: Dose Expansion part will consist of multiple cohorts
        by cancer types. Cohort 1 will be initiated to determine the RD after completion
        of Part 1. The RD will be determined among two dose levels investigated in
        Cohort 1 based on the totality of available data including PK, biomarkers,
        dose-response, safety, and efficacy.'
