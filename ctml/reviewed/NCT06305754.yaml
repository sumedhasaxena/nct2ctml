summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate sacituzumab tirumotecan versus
  pemetrexed in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer
  (NSCLC). Participants in this study have NSCLC that has continued to progress on
  prior treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).


  The primary hypotheses of this study are that sacituzumab tirumotecan is better
  than platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (pemetrexed and carboplatin) in regard
  to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).'
