- 7. Willing to have a tumor biopsy or having tissue sample from a previous biopsy
  available in the tissue bank for analysis that had been collected in the past 3
  years.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Significant concurrent medical diseases, such as congestive heart failure,
  unstable angina, acute or recent myocardial infarction (\< 6 months before enrollment),
  COPD with frequent exacerbations, uncontrolled hypertension (systemic blood pressure
  \>= 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \>= 100 mmHg with or without anti-hypertensive
  medication), recent CVA (\< 6 months before enrollment), or active infection which
  requires treatment withintravenous antibiotics.
- Exclude - 2. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases who are neurologically unstable,
  receiving radiotherapy for the CNS lesion, or requiring increasing dose of steroids
  to control their CNS disease.
- Exclude - Asymptomatic patients with metastatic brain disease who have been on a
  stable dose of steroids for less than 14 days prior to screening.
- 'Exclude - 3. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function as demonstrated by
  any of the following laboratory values:'
- 'Exclude - Bone marrow:'
- Exclude - * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1.5 x 10\^9/L
- Exclude - * Platelet count \< 100 x 10\^9/L
- Exclude - * Hemoglobin \< 9 g/dL

  or ability to give consent.
- Exclude - 6. Major surgical intervention within 4 weeks of the first dose of LXP1788
  Injection or with ongoing postoperative complications.
- Exclude - 7. Toxicities from any prior therapy, surgery, or radiotherapy that did
  not resolve to grade 0 or 1 as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common
  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, with the exception
  of alopecia, skin hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.
- Exclude - 8. Underlying medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion,
  will make the administration of LXP1788 Injection hazardous or obscure the interpretation
  of toxicities or adverse events.
- Exclude - 9. Exposure to any other investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents
  or curative therapies within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter), before
  the first dose of LXP1788 Injection. Exposure to radiation therapy for non-curative
  purposes or pain control may be permitted under the judgement of the investigator.
- Exclude - 10. Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate
  in the study because the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions,
  or requirements.
- Exclude - 11. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

  means of contraception.
- Exclude - 13. Positive test for hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (positive HCV

summary: 'A Phase I, open-label, first-in-human study to determine the MTD, recommended
  phase 2 dose (RP2D), assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
  anti-tumor activity of LXP1788 Injection in patients with advanced solid tumor.


  Patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to currently available therapies
  or for whom no effective treatment is available will be selected.


  The main questions it aims to answer are:


  1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose
  (RP2D) of LXP1788 Injection

  2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LXP1788 Injection'
