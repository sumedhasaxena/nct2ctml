- 5. Histology proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Biopsy at nasopharynx is mandatory.
- 6. Completing radiotherapy more than 66Gy (curative intent radiotherapy)
- '7. Detectable plasma EBV DNA: it is defined by the following criteria:'
- '1. The first test of plasma EBV DNA: 6-8 weeks after the last dose of radiotherapy.'
- '2. If the first test of plasma EBV DNA is detectable:'
- '* Within the "linear dynamic range": eligible by one single EBV DNA testing'
- '* Lower than the "linear dynamic range": it should be repeated within 2-4 weeks
  after the report day of first test of plasma EBV DNA. If both results are detectable,
  the patient is eligible'
- '* \*The "linear dynamic range" is defined as the highest to the lowest quantifiable

- '8. No detectable residual disease or distant metastases after imaging studies:
  The following examinations should be completed within 28 days after the report day
  of detectable plasma EBV DNA. If a repeated test of plasma EBV DNA is necessary
  by criteria 7, the following examination should be completed within 28 days after
  the report day of the repeated plasma EBV DNA test.'
- 1. For locally residual disease, head and neck MRI should be completed. For patients
  who cannot take MRI, CT scan with and without contrast should be completed.
- 2. For distant metastases, one of the following studies should be completed.
- '* Whole body PET-CT scan (if the modality is available)'
- '* CT scan with and without contrast of chest and abdomen, and bone scan'
- 9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
  pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative,
  a serum pregnancy test will be required.
- '10. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.5.2) must be willing to
  use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.5.2 - Contraception,
  for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.
  Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
  for the subject.'
- '11. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.5.2) must agree to use an
  adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.5.2- Contraception, starting
  with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study
  therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
  contraception for the subject.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the
  subject:'
- Exclude - 1. Other malignancies diagnosed before or concurrently with the diagnosis
  of NPC.
- Exclude - 2. Take chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents after curative chemoradiation.
- Exclude - 3. Documented residual / recurrent local disease or distant metastases
  after completing chemoradiation.
- Exclude - 4. Plasma EBV DNA is un-detectable.
- Exclude - 5. Unresolved grade 2 or more acute toxicities related to chemoradiation
- Exclude - 6. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated
  in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
  device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.
- Exclude - 7. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.
- Exclude - 8. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
  in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids
  or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
  corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.)
  is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Topical or inhaled steroids is not
  considered as systemic treatment.
- Exclude - 9. Has known history of pneumonitis requiring steroids, or any evidence
  of active, non-infectious pneumonitis
- Exclude - 10. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy 14 days before
  signing informed consent.
- Exclude - 11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
  abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
  participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest
  of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
- Exclude - 12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere
  with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
- Exclude - 13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children
  within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening
  visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.
- Exclude - 14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2
  agent.
- Exclude - 15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2

- "Exclude - 17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study\
  \ therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated\
  \ flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\xAE\
  ) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed."

summary: This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, phase II trial to examine
  the efficacy of pembrolizumab for prolonging the one-year disease free survival
  in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with solely detectable EBV DNA after curative
  chemoradiation. Sixty-three patients will be enrolled in the trial.
