summary: The goal of this Phase 3 clinical trial is study the safety and efficacy
  of the nextgen anti-CTLA-4 antibody, gotistobart (ONC-392/BNT316), in patients with
  metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have disease progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1
  antibody based therapy. The study will test whether gotistobart, in comparison with
  chemotherapy agent docetaxel, could prolong the life for NSCLC patients. Patients
  will be randomized to be treated with either gotistobart or docetaxel, IV infusion,
  once every 21 days, for up to 17 cycles in approximately one year.
