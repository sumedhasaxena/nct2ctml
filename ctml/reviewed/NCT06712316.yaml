prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB or IIIC
  (who are not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy) or Stage IV NSCLC per
  the Union Internationale contre le Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging
  system, 8th edition without actionable epidermal growth factor receptor mutation
  or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement.'
- '* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST v1.1.
  Lesions treated after prior local treatment (radiotherapy, ablation, interventional
  procedures, etc.) are generally not considered as target lesions. If the lesion
  with prior local treatment is the only targeted lesion, evidence-based radiology
  must be provided to demonstrate disease progression (the single bone metastasis
  or the single central nervous system metastasis should not be considered as a measurable
  lesion).'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC with small-cell
  lung cancer histologic component.
- 'Exclude - * Have received any of the following therapies or drugs within the noted
  time intervals prior to study treatment:'
- Exclude - * Participants who received prior treatment with anti-VEGF monoclonal
  antibody, or PD(L)-1/VEGF bispecific antibody or received platinum-based chemotherapy
  and/or anti-PD(L)-1 as part of adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment
- 'Exclude - * Have received systemic corticosteroids (at a dosage greater than 10
  mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroids) within 14 days
  prior to the initiation of study treatment. Note: local, intranasal, intraocular,
  intra-articular or inhaled corticosteroids, short-term use (\<=7 days) of corticosteroids
  for prophylaxis (e.g., prevention of contrast agent allergy) or treatment of non-autoimmune
  conditions (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by exposure to allergens)
  are allowed.'
- Exclude - * Have uncontrolled hypertension or poorly controlled diabetic conditions
  prior to study treatment.
- Exclude - * Have a serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. This includes
  history (within 6 months prior to study entry) or risk of abdominal fistula, tracheoesophageal
  fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess. In addition,
  the participant must have undergone correction (or spontaneous healing) of the perforation/fistula
  and/or the underlying process causing fistula/perforation.
- Exclude - * Participants with evidence of major coagulation disorders or other significant
  risks of hemorrhage.
- Exclude - * Have superior vena cava syndrome or symptoms of spinal cord compression.
- 'Exclude - NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'This is a Phase 2/3, multisite, randomized, open-label study in participants
  with first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


  This study includes two substudies (substudy A and substudy B) that will recruit
  participants according to histological subtypes due to differences in chemotherapy
  choice for standard-of-care and type of NSCLC.'
