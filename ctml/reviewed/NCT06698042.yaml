summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat non-small cell lung cancer
  (NSCLC) that is metastatic, which means cancer has spread to other parts of the
  body.


  Some people with metastatic NSCLC are treated with pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy
  treatment that is given into a vein as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Pembrolizumab
  (+) Berahyaluronidase alfa is pembrolizumab that is given under the skin as a subcutaneous
  (SC) injection. The goal of this study is to compare what happens to pembrolizumab
  in a person''s body over time when it is given as an IV infusion or SC injection.'
