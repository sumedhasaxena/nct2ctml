prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Are female adults (defined as \u226518 years of age or acceptable age according\
  \ to local regulations at the time of voluntarily giving informed consent)."
- '* Have histologically confirmed endometrial cancer that:'
- '* Is recurrent,'
- '* Has a HER2 IHC score of 1+, 2+, or 3+ as determined by central laboratory testing
  for HER2 protein expression, and'
- '* Is not defined as a true sarcoma (i.e., leiomyosarcoma or endometrial stromal
  sarcoma). Note: Uterine carcinosarcoma is allowed.'
- '* Have measurable disease defined by RECIST 1.1.'
- '* Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1 or
  2.'
- '* Have had at least one prior line of platinum-based therapy (in any setting).
  Up to three lines of prior therapy are allowed. Prior hormonal therapy and radiation
  are allowed and do not count as prior lines of therapy. Platinum-based chemotherapy
  and ICI may have been given together or in separate lines of therapy.'
- "* Have a life expectancy of \u226512 weeks at screening."
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Ineligible for all options in the investigator's choice of chemotherapy
  arm. Participants with contraindications to paclitaxel and doxorubicin treatment,
  per local prescribing information and institutional guidelines, cannot be enrolled
  to the study.
- Exclude - * Have a history of small bowel obstruction requiring hospitalization
  within the past 3 months prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance
  with study requirement or substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events
  (AEs).
- Exclude - * Have clinically uncontrolled pleural effusion, ascites or pericardial
  effusion requiring drainage, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free concentrated ascites
  reinfusion therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Have a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
  that required steroids, have current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis
  cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.
- Exclude - * Participants with prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14
  days prior to first dose of study treatment, except for intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids
  or systemic corticosteroids at doses of less than 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent,
  and topical corticosteroids. Participants receiving corticosteroids may continue
  if the dose is stable upon giving informed consent.
- Exclude - * Have a lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illness including,
  but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (e.g., pulmonary emboli within
  3 months prior to study randomization, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disorder, restrictive lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, radiation pneumonitis,
  significant pleural effusion etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory
  disorder with pulmonary involvement (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome,
  sarcoidosis etc.), and/or prior pneumonectomy (complete).
- Exclude - * Have uncontrolled infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals,
  or antifungals within 2 weeks prior to randomization.
- "Exclude - * Have unresolved toxicities from previous anti-cancer therapy, defined\
  \ as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to Grade \u22641 or baseline."
- Exclude - * Are pregnant or breastfeeding or are planning pregnancy during the study
  or within 7 months after the last dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Have a history of allergies, hypersensitivities, or intolerance to the
  study treatments (investigational medicinal products and auxiliary medicinal product)
  including any excipients thereof or to other monoclonal antibodies.
- Exclude - * Had prior treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors, including ADCs
  with exatecans.
- Exclude - * Have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \<55% by either echocardiography
  (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) within 28 days before randomization.
  This includes participants with tissue doppler E/e' ratio \>15.
- 'Exclude - NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: The goal of this clinical study is to assess the efficacy of BNT323/DB-1303
  compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy in terms of progression-free
  survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the endometrial cancer
  population with prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment.
