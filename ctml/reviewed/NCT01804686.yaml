prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participants must be currently participating in an ibrutinib clinical study considered
  complete and have received at least 6 months of treatment with ibrutinib. At study
  entry, participants must be actively receiving treatment with single-agent ibrutinib;
  or participants must have participated in an ibrutinib randomized clinical study
  in which they initially received comparator treatment and now cross-over to ibrutinib.
  Note: A minimum of 6 months requirement for prior ibrutinib treatment will not be
  mandatory in this case and participants with less than 6 months will be required
  to have more frequent initial safety assessments; or participants must be currently
  participating in study PCI-32765LYM1002. At study entry, participants must be actively
  receiving combination treatment with ibrutinib and nivolumab or single-agent ibrutinib'
- '* Investigator''s assessment that the benefit of continued ibrutinib therapy as
  a single agent or in combination with nivolumab will outweigh the risks'
- '* Agrees to protocol-defined use of effective contraception'
- '* Negative blood or urine pregnancy test at screening'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists
- Exclude - * Requires treatment with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 inhibitors,
  unless previously approved by sponsor
- Exclude - * Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator,
  may put the participant at significant risk, may confound the study results, or
  may interfere significantly with volunteer's participation in the study

summary: The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and efficacy data
  for participants treated with ibrutinib and to provide ongoing access to ibrutinib
  for participants who are currently enrolled in ibrutinib studies that have been
  completed according to the parent protocol, are actively receiving treatment with
  ibrutinib, and who continue to benefit from ibrutinib treatment.
