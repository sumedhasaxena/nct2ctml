  \ than 18 years of age at study entry. Adult formulation group: \u2265 14 and less\
  \ than 18 years of age and body weight of \u2265 40 kg at study entry."
- '* Participants with Ph+ CML-CP must meet all of the following laboratory values
  at the screening visit. In the case where bone marrow blast and promyelocyte counts
  are available, these will be accepted if done within 56 days prior to the screening
  visit, to avoid unnecessary repetition of this test.'
- 1. \< 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow
- 2. \< 30% combined blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow
- 3. \< 20% basophils in the peripheral blood
- "4. Neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10\\^9/L (or WBC \u2265 3 x 10\\^9/L if neutrophils\
  \ are not available) and platelet count \u2265 100 x 10\\^9/L"
- 5. No evidence of extramedullary leukemic involvement, with the exception of hepatosplenomegaly
- '* Prior treatment with a minimum of one TKI'
- '* Failure (adapted from the 2020 European Leukemia Net (ELN) Guidelines Hochhaus
  et al 2020 and 2013 ELN Guidelines Baccarani et al 2013) or intolerance to the most
  recent TKI therapy at the time of screening.'
- "* Performance status: Karnofsky \u2265 50% for patients \u2265 16 years of age,\
  \ and Lansky \u2265 50 for patients \\< 16 years of age at the time of screening"
- '* Participants must have adequate renal, hepatic, pancreatic and cardiac function'
- '* Participants must have electrolyte values within normal limits or corrected to
  be within normal limits with supplements prior to first dose of study medication:'
- '* Evidence of typical BCR-ABL1 transcript \[e14a2 and/or e13a2\] at the time of
  screening which are amenable to standardized RQ-PCR quantification.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Known presence of the T315I mutation prior to study entry or a BCR::ABL
  mutation with known resistance to study treatment any time prior to study entry.
- Exclude - * Known second chronic phase of CML after previous progression to AP/BC.
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with a hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
- Exclude - * Patient planning to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
- Exclude - * Cardiac or cardiac repolarization abnormality
- Exclude - * Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the opinion
  of the Investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance
  with the protocol
- Exclude - * History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of study entry or past medical
  history of chronic pancreatitis.
- Exclude - * History of acute or chronic liver disease.
- Exclude - * Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
  significantly alter the absorption of study drug
- Exclude - * Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females.

summary: The aim of this study is to support development of asciminib in the pediatric
  population (1 to \<18 years) previously treated with one or more TKIs. Full extrapolation
  of the efficacy of asciminib from adult to pediatric patients will be conducted.
  Full extrapolation is based on the concept that CML in the pediatric population
  has the same pathogenesis, similar clinical characteristics and progression pattern
  as in adults.
