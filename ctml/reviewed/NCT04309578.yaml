prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Patients with inoperable, locally-advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic gastric
  adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who are not eligible
  for curative therapy and are histologically diagnosed.
- 2. Diseases measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
  (RECIST1.1) using imaging technique (CT or MRI).
- 3. Tissue HER2-negative tumors (primary or metastatic tumors) defined as IHC2+ and
  FISH- or IHC 0 or 1+ according to gastric cancer assessment system for HER2 (see
  Annex 12.5).
- 4. ECOG Performance status 0, 1 or 2 (see Annex 12.1).
- 5. Survival for at least 3 months should be possible.
- 6. Appropriate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic functions. General inclusion criteria
- 7. Males or females aged 19 years.
- 8. Patients should sign the informed consent form (ICF).
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Patients who previously received chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic
  diseases (adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, completed at least 6 months prior to
  enrollment in this clinical study, is permitted, but platinum-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy is not permitted).
- Exclude - 2. Patients with a lack of physical integration of the upper gastrointestinal
  tract or with a malabsorption syndrome (e.g., patients who underwent partial or
  total gastric resection can participate in this clinical study, but patients equipped
  with a jejunostomy tube cannot participate).
- Exclude - 3. Patients with active (serious or uncontrolled) gastrointestinal bleeding.
- "Exclude - 4. Patients with relevant toxicities remaining following previous curative\
  \ therapy (except for alopecia). For example, neurotoxicity \u2265 grade 2 based\
  \ on NCI-CTCAE version 5.0."
- Exclude - 5. Patients with a history of other malignant diseases based on the date
  of complete recovery within 5 years prior to the initiation of treatment in this
  clinical study (except for in-situ cervical cancer and basal cell carcinoma).
- Exclude - Hematologic, blood chemistry, and organ functions
- "Exclude - 6. Neutrophil count \\< 1.5 \xD7 109/L, or platelet count \\< 100 \xD7\
  \ 109/L."
- "Exclude - 7. Serum bilirubin\\> 1.5 \xD7 upper limit of normal (ULN); or AST or\
  \ ALT \\> 2.5 \xD7 ULN (or \\> 5 \xD7 ULN hepatic metastasis patients); or alkaline\
  \ phosphatase \\> 2.5 \xD7 ULN (or \\> 5 \xD7 ULN hepatic metastasis patients, or\
  \ \\> 10 \xD7 ULN hepatic metastasis-free bone metastasis patients); or, albumin\
  \ \\< 2.5 g/dL."
- "Exclude - 8. Creatinine clearance \\< 60 mL/min. However, creatinine clearance\
  \ is first calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula, and if the value is \\<\
  \ 60ml/min, a 24hr urine collection test is carried out. Subject enrollment is possible\
  \ only when creatinine clearance is \u2265 60mL/min."
- Exclude - Other investigational product-associated exclusion criteria
- Exclude - 9. History of proven congestive heart failure; angina pectoris in need
  of medication; evidence of transmural myocardial infarction through electrocardiogram
  (ECG); uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \> 180 mmHg or diastolic
  blood pressure \> 100 mmHg); clinically significant heart valve disorders; and high-risk
  uncontrolled arrhythmia.
- Exclude - 10. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \< 50% (measured
  with echocardiogram or MUGA).
- Exclude - 11. Patients with dyspnoea at rest due to advanced tumors or other diseases,
  or who need an adjuvant oxygen therapy.
- Exclude - 12. Patients who are treated with long-term or high-dose corticosteroids
  (steroid inhalation or short-term use of oral steroids for vomiting inhibition and
  appetite stimulation is permitted).
- Exclude - 13. Patients with Clinically significant hypoacusis
- Exclude - 14. Patients known to show dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.
  General exclusion criteria
- Exclude - 15. Patients with a history of brain metastasis or clinical evidence.
- Exclude - 16. Uncontrolled serious systemic intercurrent diseases (e.g., infection
  or uncontrolled diabetes).
- Exclude - 17. Females who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
- Exclude - 18. Fertile males and females who are unwilling to use effective contraceptive
  methods.
- Exclude - 19. Patients who are treated with another investigational product within
  4 weeks prior to the initiation of treatment in this clinical study.
- Exclude - 20. Patients receiving radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the initiation
  of treatment with the study drug (palliative radiation curative therapy that is
  partially carried out for bone metastasis. Washout period of 2 weeks is also permitted
  in patients recovered from all acute toxicities.).
- Exclude - 21. Patients who underwent major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the initiation
  of treatment with the study drug and have not yet been completely recovered.
- Exclude - 22. Patients known to have HIV infectivity or active infection with HBV
  or HCV.
- Exclude - 23. Patients with hypersensitivity to the study drug.
