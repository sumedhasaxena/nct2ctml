      arm_description: After the intravenous (IV) administration of 300 mg of tremelimumab
        and 1,500 mg of durvalumab, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) will be
        performed in combination with 1,500 mg of durvalumab via IV infusion every
        4 weeks (Q4W) until disease progression (PD) is confirmed. TACE will be carried
        out 1 to 2 weeks (7 to 14 days) after the administration of tremelimumab +
        durvalumab, and thereafter, it will be performed as needed at the discretion
        of the investigator during the treatment period. If additional TACE is performed,
        there must be at least a 1-week interval between the additional TACE and the
        administration of durvalumab.
