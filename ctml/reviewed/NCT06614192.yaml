summary: 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed
  worldwide and in China. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events disease
  activity when comparing intravenously (IV) infused telisotuzumab adizutecan to trifluridine
  and tipiracil (LONSURF) oral tablets plus IV infused bevacizumab in adult participants
  with c-Met protein above cutoff level refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).


  Telisotuzumab adizutecan is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment
  of CRC. Participants are put into treatment arms as part of 2 stages. Each treatment
  arm in stage 1 receives a different dose of telisotuzumab adizutecan. Each treatment
  arm in stage 2 receives the optimal dose of telisotuzumab adizutecan or LONSURF
  plus bevacizumab. Up to approximately 460 adult participants with c-Met protein
  above cutoff level refractory mCRC, will be enrolled in the study in approximately
  160 sites in 15-20 countries.


  In stage 1, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused telisotuzumab adizutecan
  dose A or B. In stage 2, participants will receive the optimal dose of IV infused
  telisotuzumab adizutecan or the standard of care (SOC), LONSURF oral tablets plus
  IV infused bevacizumab. The total study duration will be approximately 4 years.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
