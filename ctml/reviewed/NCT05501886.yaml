- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally
  advanced breast cancer Adult females, pre- and/or post-menopausal, and adult males.
  Pre-menopausal (and peri-menopausal) women can be enrolled if amenable to treatment
  with an LHRH agonist. Patients are to have commenced concomitant treatment with
  LHRH agonist prior to or on Cycle 1, Day 1 and must be willing to continue on it
  for the duration of the study.
- 2. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Female subjects
  of childbearing potential must use an effective and/or acceptable contraceptive
  method from screening until 1 year after the last dose of study treatment
- 3. Confirmed diagnosis of estrogen receptor positive and/or progesterone receptor
  positive, as per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists
  (ASCO-CAP) guidelines (2020), based on most recent tumor biopsy utilizing an assay
  consistent with local standards

- 5. Adequate archival or fresh tumor tissue for the analysis of PIK3CA mutational
  status
- 6. Subject must have documentation of radiological disease progression on or after
  the last prior treatment and also have radiologically evaluable disease (measurable
  and/or non-measurable) according to RECIST v1.1, per local assessment. Subjects
  with bone only disease must have lytic or mixed lytic/blastic lesions that can be
  accurately assessed; bone only blastic lesions with no soft tissue component is
  not allowed.
- 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

  a protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor, or a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  inhibitor
- Exclude - 3. Prior treatment with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates for
  advanced disease is not permitted (prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is
  permitted)
- Exclude - 4. More than 2 lines of prior endocrine therapy treatment
- Exclude - 5. Bone only disease that is only blastic with no soft tissue component
- Exclude - 6. Subjects with type 1 diabetes or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes

  may be enrolled in the study if they meet the following criteria: do not require
  supportive therapy with steroids; do not have seizures and do not exhibit uncontrolled
  neurological symptoms; stable disease confirmed by radiographic assessment within
  at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment'
- Exclude - 8. Patients with advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread that are at risk
  of life-threatening complication in the short-term
- "Exclude - 9. History of clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities such\
  \ as: Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification\
  \ \u2265 II within 6 months of study entry"
- Exclude - 1. Myocardial infarction within 12 months of study entry
- Exclude - 2. History of any uncontrolled (or untreated) clinically significant cardiac
  arrhythmias, (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block,
  high grade AV block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV
  block), supraventricular, nodal arrhythmias, or conduction abnormality in the previous
  12 months
- "Exclude - 3. Uncontrolled hypertension defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP)\
  \ \u2265160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2265100 mmHg, with or without\
  \ antihypertensive medication (initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication\\\
  [s\\] is allowed prior to screening)"

  long QT syndrome, or any of the following:'
- Exclude - * i. Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) including uncorrected
  hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic
  bradycardia
- Exclude - * ii. On screening, inability to determine the corrected QT interval using
  Fridericia's formula (QTcF) on the ECG (i.e., unreadable or not interpretable) or
  QTcF \>480 msec (determined by mean of triplicate ECGs at screening)
- Exclude - 10. Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or their components
- Exclude - 11. Pregnant or breast-feeding women
- Exclude - 12. Concurrent participation in another interventional clinical trial
- Exclude - 1. Subjects must agree not to participate in another clinical trial (other
