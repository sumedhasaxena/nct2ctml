  or been offered and chosen not to receive systemic therapy'
- '* Inadequate response to prior liver-directed therapy (e.g., TACE, bland embolization,
  Y90, ablation, radiation therapy) to the same targeted area or progressive disease
  after prior liver-directed therapy) or to one or more systemic therapies'
- '* Not a candidate for curative resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneous
  ablation (See Protocol Appendix 3)'
- "* Eastern Collective Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u22641 (See Protocol\
  \ Appendix 5)"
- '* Adequate laboratory parameters, including:'
- "* Serum total bilirubin \u2264 2x ULN"
- '* Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate aminotransferase

- '* All subjects must be surgically sterile, at least two years post-menopausal (if
  female), or agree to use adequate, effective contraception approved by the Investigator
  until two (2) months after receiving a final dose of CSR02-Fab-TF'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Eligible for transplantation by Milan criteria (Protocol Appendix 3)
  or potentially eligible if successfully "down staged" by pre-transplant therapy
- Exclude - * Prior organ transplantation
- Exclude - * Any small molecule drug treatment for HCC (including TACE) within the
  previous 30 days, treatment with biological agents or any investigational therapy
  within the previous 60 days, or treatment with Y90 within the previous 90 days.
- Exclude - * Previously treated malignancies from which the subject has not been
  disease-free for at least 2 years, except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin
  cancer, in situ cancer, or low-grade prostate or bladder cancer
- Exclude - * Severe chronic obstructive or other pulmonary disease with hypoxemia
  that requires supplementary oxygen or clinically significant pleural effusions
- Exclude - * New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, cardiac disease,
  myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to therapy, unstable arrhythmia, symptomatic
  peripheral arterial vascular disease, or presence of an artificial or other vascular
  device requiring chronic anticoagulation (See Protocol Appendix 6)
- 'Exclude - * Any of the following risks related to QT/QTc interval:'
- Exclude - * Baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (repeated interval \> 480 milliseconds
  using Frederica's QT correction formula);
- Exclude - * History of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. heart
  failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT syndrome);

  60 days
- Exclude - * Known inherited thrombophilia (hypercoagulable state) or history of
  unprovoked venous or arterial thrombosis
- Exclude - * Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring
  systemic therapy at screening. Subjects with prior HBV (positive HBSAg) must have
  HBV viral load \< 2000 IU/mL or be receiving concurrent anti-HBV therapy to be eligible.
  Subjects on anti-HBV therapy must have been on treatment with a viral load maintained
  at \< 2000 IU/mL for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose and continue on this same
  therapy throughout study treatment. Subjects with HCV infection are eligible if
  other eligibility criteria are met
- Exclude - * Females who are breast-feeding
- Exclude - * Allergy to iodinated contrast medium that is uncontrolled or refractory
  to medical therapy
- Exclude - * Therapeutic anticoagulation that cannot be stopped 24-72 hours before
  treatment (per Section 4.5) and reinstituted no sooner than 72 hours after therapy
- Exclude - * Any concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct
  of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable
  risk to the subject in this study
- Exclude - * Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any
  reason

summary: Intra-arterial (IA) therapy is generally used to treat HCC tumors that are
  too extensive to excise or treat with potentially curative local therapy. IA therapy
  takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply of HCC comes predominantly from
  the hepatic artery compared with the surrounding normal liver which is predominantly
  supplied by portal venous blood. The intent is to deprive the HCC of its blood supply,
  leading to the death of the tumor. Traditionally, various methods have been used
  to block the HCC blood supply, but improvements are needed. This study will investigate
  a new agent designed in the laboratory to block only tumor blood vessels, not blood
  vessels in the normal liver.
