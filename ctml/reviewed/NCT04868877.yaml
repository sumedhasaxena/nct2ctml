prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Part One: Patients with NSCLC, GC/GEJ, HNSCC, or ESCC who have failed prior standard
  first-line treatment. Patients must have progressed on or be intolerant to therapies
  that are known to provide clinical benefit. There is no limit to the number of prior
  treatment regimens.'
- 'Part Two: Patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, other solid tumors and applicable mutations
  as determined by the investigator.'
- '* Availability of archival or a fresh tumor tissue sample.'
- '* Measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 by radiologic methods.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.'
- "* Life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks, as per Investigator."
- '* Adequate organ function (as per protocol)'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Central nervous system metastases that are untreated or symptomatic,
  or require radiation, surgery, or continued steroid therapy (\> 10 mg prednisone
  or equivalent) to control symptoms within 14 days of study entry.
- Exclude - * Known leptomeningeal involvement.
- Exclude - * Participation in another clinical study or treatment with any investigational
  drug within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
- Exclude - * Systemic anticancer therapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives,
  whichever is shorter, of the first dose of study drug. For cytotoxic agents that
  have major delayed toxicity (e.g., mitomycin C, nitrosoureas), a washout period
  of 6 weeks is required.
- "Exclude - * Major surgery or radiotherapy within 3 weeks of the first dose of study\
  \ drug. Patients who received prior radiotherapy to \u226525% of bone marrow at\
  \ any time are not eligible."
- "Exclude - * Persistent grade \\>1 clinically significant toxicities related to\
  \ prior antineoplastic therapies (except for alopecia); stable sensory neuropathy\
  \ \u2264 grade 2 NCI-CTCAE v5.0 and hypothyroidism \u2264 grade 2 which is stable\
  \ on hormone replacement are allowed."
- Exclude - * History of hypersensitivity reaction or any toxicity attributed to human
  proteins or any of the excipients that warranted permanent cessation of these agents.
  History of hypersensitivity reaction or any toxicity attributed to chemotherapy
  and components.
- Exclude - * History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease
- Exclude - * Past medical history of ILD or pneumonitis, or any evidence of clinically
  active ILD or pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Previous or concurrent malignancy, excluding non-basal cell carcinomas
  of skin or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, unless the tumor was treated
  with curative or palliative intent and in the opinion of the Investigator, with
  Sponsor agreement, the previous or concurrent malignancy condition does not affect
  the assessment of safety and efficacy of the study drug.
- Exclude - * Current serious illness or medical conditions including, but not limited
  to uncontrolled active infection, clinically significant pulmonary, metabolic or
  psychiatric disorders
- Exclude - * Active Hepatitis B infection without receiving antiviral treatment.
- Exclude - * Positive test for Hepatitis C
- Exclude - * Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with HIV with undetectable
  viral load are allowed. In
