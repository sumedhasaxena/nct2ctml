summary: This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion
  study of the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of IDE397 as a
  single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents including taxanes (docetaxel,
  paclitaxel), or sacituzumab govitecan (SG), in adult patients with selected advanced
  or metastatic MTAP-deleted advanced solid tumors who are unresponsive to standard
  of care therapy. IDE397 is a small molecule inhibitor of methionine adenosyltransferase
  2 alpha (MAT2A).
