summary: 'B-cell Lymphoma is an aggressive and rare cancer of a type of immune cells
  (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). Follicular Lymphoma is
  a slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
  is the most common leukemia (cancer of blood cells). The purpose of this study is
  to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of
  ABBV-319 in adult participants in relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large b-cell
  lymphoma (DLBCL), R/R follicular lymphoma (FL), or R/R CLL. Adverse events will
  be assessed.


  ABBV-319 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R DLBCL,
  R/R FL, or R/R CLL. This study will include a dose escalation phase to determine
  the doses of ABBV-319 that will be used in the next phase and a dose expansion phase
  to determine the change in disease activity in participants with R/R DLBCL, R/R
  FL, and R/R CLL. Approximately 154 adult participants with R/R B cell lymphomas
  including R/R DLBCL, R/R FL, and R/R CLL will be enrolled in the study in sites
  world wide.


  In the Dose Escalation phase of the study participants will receive escalating intravenously
  infused doses of ABBV-319 in 21-day cycles, until the Phase 2 dose is determined.
  In the dose expansion phase of the study participants receive intravenously infused
  ABBV-319 in 21-day cycles.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
