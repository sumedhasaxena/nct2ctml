prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC (non small lung cancer), including
  all histological subtypes.'
- '* Stage IV mNSCLC (metastatic non-small cell lung cancer) (based on the American
  Joint Committee on Cancer Edition 8) not amenable to curative treatment.'
- '* Absence of sensitizing EGFR (epidermal growth factor) mutations and ALK (anaplastic
  lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) rearrangements. Negative assay result
  is required for all non-squamous histology subtypes.'
- '* Absence of documented tumor genomic mutation results from tests conducted as
  part of standard local practice in any other actionable driver oncogenes for which
  there are locally approved targeted 1L (first line) therapies.'
- '* WHO (World Health Organization)/ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance
  status of 0 or 1, with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks prior to baseline
  at screening and prior to randomization.'
- '* Minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.'
- '* Provision of acceptable tumor sample for the central testing prior to randomization.'
- "* At least one lesion not previously irradiated that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1\
  \ (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1) TL (target lesion)\
  \ at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the\
  \ longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm)\
  \ with CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and is suitable\
  \ for accurate repeated measurements."
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * As judged by the investigator, any severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases,
  makes it undesirable for the participant to participate in the study or that would
  jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
- Exclude - * History of organ transplant.
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring
  chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.
- "Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated\
  \ with curative intent with no known active disease \u2265 2 years before the first\
  \ dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence."
- Exclude - * Presence of small cell and neuroendocrine histology components.
- Exclude - * Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not requiring steroids
  or anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Active primary immunodeficiency/active infectious disease(s)
- Exclude - * Active tuberculosis infection
- Exclude - * Any prior systemic therapy received for advanced or mNSCLC (metastatic
  non-small cell lung cancer).
- Exclude - * Any prior exposure to an anti-TIGIT (T-cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain) therapy or any other anticancer therapy
  targeting immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms.
- Exclude - * Any prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein
  1) or anti-PD-L1 (anti-programmed death-ligand 1) agent.

summary: The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung04 is to assess the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig
  compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy as 1L treatment in participants with mNSCLC
  and whose tumors express PD-L1.
