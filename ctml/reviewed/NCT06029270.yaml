summary: This phase II trial tests the addition of BMS-986016 (relatlimab) to the
  usual immunotherapy after initial treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer that has come
  back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or that has spread from where it
  first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Relatlimab
  is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
  and spread. The usual approach of treatment is initial treatment with chemotherapy
  such as the combination of cisplatin (or carboplatin) and gemcitabine, along with
  immunotherapy such as nivolumab. After the initial treatment is finished, patients
  may continue to receive additional immunotherapy. Carboplatin is in a class of medications
  known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer
  drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by
  killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
  antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer,
  and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Gemcitabine
  is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
  and may kill cancer cells. Giving BMS-986016 in addition to the usual immunotherapy
  after initial treatment may extend the time without the tumor cells growing or spreading
  longer than the usual approach in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal
  cancer.
