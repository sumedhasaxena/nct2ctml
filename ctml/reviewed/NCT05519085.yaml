- Inclusion Criteria
- \- Participant has documented diagnosis of MM and measurable disease, defined as
  any of the following:.
- "i) M-protein \u2265 0.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) by serum protein electrophoresis\
  \ (sPEP) or."
- "ii) M-protein \u2265 200 milligrams (mg) per 24-hour urine collection by urine\
  \ protein electrophoresis (uPEP)."
- 'iii) For participants without measurable disease in sPEP or uPEP: serum free light
  chain (sFLC) levels \> 100 mg/L (10 mg/dL) involved light chain and an abnormal
  kappa/lambda FLC ratio.'
- '* Participants received 1 to 3 prior lines of antimyeloma therapy.'
- '* Participants achieved minimal response \[MR\] or better to at least 1 prior antimyeloma
  therapy.'
- Exclude - Exclusion Criteria
- Exclude - \- Participant has had progression during treatment or within 60 days
  of the last dose of a proteasome inhibitor, except as noted below:.
- Exclude - i) Subjects who progressed while being treated with, or within 60 days
  of last dose of bortezomib maintenance given once every 2 weeks (or less frequently)
  are not excluded.
- "Exclude - ii) Participants who progressed while being treated with ixazomib monotherapy\
  \ maintenance \u2265 6 months prior to the time of starting study treatment are\
  \ not excluded."
- Exclude - * For participants with prior treatment of a bortezomib containing regimen,
  the best response achieved was not a minimal response (MR) or better, or participant
  discontinued bortezomib due to toxicity.
- Exclude - * Participant has had prior treatment with mezigdomide or pomalidomide.

summary: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of mezigdomide
  (CC-92480), bortezomib and dexamethasone (MeziVd) versus pomalidomide, bortezomib
  and dexamethasone (PVd) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
  (RRMM) who received between 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and who have had prior
  lenalidomide exposure.
