summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with extensive-stage
  small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has relapsed or is refractory. Gocatamig is a
  new type of immunotherapy that uses a person''s immune system to find and destroy
  cancer cells. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (also known as I-DXd) is a drug which binds
  to a specific target on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.
  Durvalumab is a different type of immunotherapy that also destroys cancer cells.
  Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig, I-DXd, and gocatamig with I-DXd or
  durvalumab can treat SCLC that did not respond or stopped responding to a prior
  treatment.


  The goals of this study are to learn:


  * If gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab are safe
  and well tolerated

  * If people who receive gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or
  durvalumab have their SCLC get smaller or go away'
