summary: 'This is a 2-part study. Part 1/Phase 1 of the study will be conducted to
  determine the safety and tolerability of CHO-H01 in subjects with relapsed/refractory
  CD20+ non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma. It will also determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
  and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).


  Part 2/Phase 2a will assess the anticancer activity and safety of CHO-H01 plus lenalidomide
  in subjects with low-grade relapsed/refractory CD20+ non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma.'
