summary: "This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belzutifan monotherapy\
  \ in participants with advanced pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL), pancreatic\
  \ neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors,\
  \ advanced wt (wild-type) gastrointestinal stromal tumor (wt GIST), or advanced\
  \ solid tumors with hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03B1) related genetic\
  \ alterations. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the objective response\
  \ rate (ORR) of belzutifan per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version\
  \ 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR)."
