summary: 'Substudy 01A is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental
  treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The larger
  study is the umbrella study (U01).


  The goal of substudy 01A is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of opevesostat-based
  treatment combinations, or as a single agent, in participants with mCRPC.


  This substudy will have two phases: a safety lead-in phase and an efficacy phase.
  The safety lead-in phase will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and
  to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the opevesostat-based treatment
  combinations. There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.'
