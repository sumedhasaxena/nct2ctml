  the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including

summary: Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a locoregional therapy commonly
  used in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with high response rates and minimal impairment
  of liver function reported. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and transarterial
  embolization (TAE) are also commonly used in HCC, with high response rates reported
  yet carry risks of impairing liver function after repeated embolization with a definitive
  embolic agent. On the other hand, lipiodol used in TACE/TAE has transient and plastic
  embolization effects on the tumor in contrast to the long-lasting embolization effect
  of the definitive embolic agent. This study investigates whether combining HAIC
  with lipiodol embolization will increase efficacy with good liver function preservation.
