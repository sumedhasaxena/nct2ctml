summary: 'Phase 1/2, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the
  safety and tolerability of neladalkib (NVL-655), determine the recommended phase
  2 dose (RP2D), and evaluate the antitumor activity in patients with advanced ALK-
  positive (ALK+) NSCLC and other solid tumors.


  Phase 1 will evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of neladalkib and will
  determine the RP2D and, if applicable, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neladalkib
  in patients with advanced ALK+ solid tumors.


  Phase 2 will determine the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Blinded
  Independent Central Review (BICR) of neladalkib at the RP2D. Secondary objectives
  will include the duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR), progression-free
  survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of neladalkib
  in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors.'
