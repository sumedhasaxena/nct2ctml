summary: Using gefitinib or Osimertinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),
  in patients with active mutations in epithelial cell growth factor receptors (EGFR),
  70% response rate (CR+PR) and 90% disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) compared to the
  current non-small cell therapy, which is significant in the EFRT treatment. However,
  resistance causes recurrence in most patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop
  a more effective treatment. Recently, in Japan, combined allotinib and bevacizumab
  therapy as primary therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation
  improved PFS statistically significantly compared to allotinib monotherapy, suggesting
  the possibility of a new treatment (Hazard ratio 0.605, 95% CI 0.417-0.877, P=0.016).
  In addition, subsequent osmutinib and bevacizumab combination therapy showed a significant
  difference in PFS in the smoker group, although they did not show significant improvement
  in PFS in the entire patient group. (Hazard ratio 0.605, 95% CI 0.417-0.877, P=0.016).
  Since EGFR mutated lung cancer is highly frequent in Korea, it is necessary to develop
  more effective treatments for such patients. Therefore, we propose this clinical
  trial to find out the efficacy of lasertinib and bevacizumab combination therapy.
