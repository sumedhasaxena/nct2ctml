summary: The purpose of this study is to compare how long the participants are disease-free
  (progression-free survival) when treated with amivantamab and chemotherapy with
  5-fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium (folinic acid) or levoleucovorin, oxaliplatin
  (mFOLFOX6) or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium (folinic acid) or levoleucovorin,
  and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) versus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI
  in adult participants with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/ Neuroblastoma
  RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
  B1 (BRAF) wild type (WT) unresectable or metastatic left-sided colorectal cancer.
