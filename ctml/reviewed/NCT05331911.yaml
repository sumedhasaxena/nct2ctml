summary: This is a two-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial. Routine perioperative
  care would be performed in volunteers with primary Hepatocellular carcinoma. The
  study will enroll approximately 500 volunteers to compare the progression-free or
  overall survival in patients undergoing elective partial hepatectomy for primary
  liver tumors between propofol and sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia.
