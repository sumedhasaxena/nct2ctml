summary: 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed
  worldwide. The purpose of this study is to assess change in disease activity when
  telisotuzumab adizutecan is given alone compared to standard of care (SOC) given
  alone.


  Telisotuzumab adizutecan is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment
  of CRC. This study will be divided into two groups called treatment arms. In arm
  1 participants will receive telisotuzumab adizutecan alone. In arm 2 participants
  will receive SOC alone. Approximately 140 adult participants with CRC will be enrolled
  in the study in 45 sites worldwide.


  In arm 1, participants will receive intravenous (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan
  alone. In arm 2 Participants will receive SOC alone. The study will run for a duration
  of approximately 51 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
