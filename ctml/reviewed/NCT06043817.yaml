prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Has histologically- or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC Stage IIIB/C
  or IV not eligible for curative intent surgery or chemoradiation
- '2. Part 1: Tumor tissue EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations confirmed by qualified
  local laboratories. Parts 2 and 3: EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations confirmed by
  qualified local laboratories'
- '3. Part 1: Has received all approved therapies for advanced or metastatic NSCLC
  or is ineligible. Part 2 and Part 3: Has received at least 1, but not more than
  2, prior lines of treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 1 of which must be
  platinum-based chemotherapy unless contraindicated'
- 4. Has documented tumor progression (based on radiological imaging)
- 5. Has new or recent tumor biopsy (collected at screening, if feasible) or archival
  tumor specimen collected in the past 10 years available for genomic profiling
- 6. Has at least one measurable tumor lesion per RECIST v1.1
- "7. Is \u226518 years of age at the time of signing the ICF"
- 8. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or
  1
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Has a tumor that is known to harbor EGFR ex20ins p.H773\_V774insH variant,
  or any EGFR kinase domain activating mutation concurrent with either a T790M and/or
  C797S resistance mutations
- "Exclude - 2. Has history (within \u22642 years before screening) of solid tumor\
  \ or hematological malignancy that is histologically distinct from NSCLC"
- Exclude - 3. Has symptomatic brain or spinal metastases
- "Exclude - 4. Has toxicities from previous anticancer therapies that have not resolved\
  \ to baseline levels or to CTCAE Grade \u22641, except for alopecia and peripheral\
  \ neuropathy"
- Exclude - 5. Has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation
  would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., could compromise the
  participant's well-being) or would prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified
  assessments

summary: Study STX-721-101 is an open label, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety,
  tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure, and preliminary antitumor activity
  of STX-721 in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying EGFR/HER2
  exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations.
