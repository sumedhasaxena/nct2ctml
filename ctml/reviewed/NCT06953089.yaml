- Exclude - * 1\. Prior treatment with B7H3 targeted therapy.
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with antibody-drug conjugate with topoisomerase inhibitor.
- Exclude - * Is a candidate to locoregional treatment with potential to induce complete
  or near complete response and prolonged tumor control, per investigator's assessment.
- Exclude - * Has an uncontrolled concomitant or intercurrent illness, that in the
  opinion of the investigator, contra-indicates trial participation, limits compliance
  with trial procedures or substantially increases the risk of incurring AEs.
- Exclude - * Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease. Has clinically
  uncontrolled pleural effusion, ascites or pericardial effusion requiring drainage,
  peritoneal shunt, or cell-free concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy.
- Exclude - * Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders.
- Exclude - * Has spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system
