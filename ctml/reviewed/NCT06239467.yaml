summary: OKI-219-101 is a Phase 1a/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study
  designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics
  (PDx), and efficacy of OKI-219 as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer
  drugs. Phase 1a (Part A) will investigate escalating doses of OKI-219 monotherapy,
  and Phase 1b will investigate OKI-219 (at a tolerated dose determined in Part A)
  in combination with fulvestrant (Part B), trastuzumab and tucatinib (Part C), atirmociclib
  (Part D), and ribociclib and fulvestrant (Part E). Participants will continue to
  receive study treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or other
  study treatment withdrawal criteria are met.
