- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Persistence of Adverse Events related to any prior treatments that have
  not recovered to Grade less than 1 by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
  Events- v5.0 unless AEs are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive
  therapy in the opinion of the Investigator (e.g. neuropathy or alopecia)
- Exclude - * Participant has a history of additional malignancy within 5 years before
  the date of enrollment other than disease under study (exceptions are squamous and
  basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, benign prostate
  neoplasm/hypertropia, or malignancy that in the opinion of the Investigator, with
  concurrence of the Sponsor's Medical Monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk
  of recurrence within 3 years)
- Exclude - * Participants with known brain metastases, except if clinically controlled,
  which is defined as individuals with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors that have
  been treated, are asymptomatic and who have discontinued steroids (for the treatment
  of CNS tumors) for more than 28 days
- Exclude - * Serious Gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months, refractory nausea
  and vomiting, uncontrolled diarrhea, known malabsorption, significant small bowel
  resection or gastric bypass surgery, use of feeding tubes, other chronic gastrointestinal

  of oral medications
- Exclude - * Cerebrovascular accident or stroke
- 'Exclude - * Module 3 only:'
- 'Exclude - * Current evidence of any of the following:'
- Exclude - 1. Any medical condition that would make prednisone (or equivalent) use
  contraindicated.
- Exclude - 2. Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid
  than 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) once daily.
- Exclude - * History of uncontrolled pituitary or adrenal dysfunction

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic,
  pharmacodynamic profile of M9466 with and without tuvusertib or an ARPi and early
  signs of clinical activity of M9466 with tuvusertib in participants with advanced
  solid tumors. Study details include: Study/Treatment Duration: Participants will
  be treated until disease progression, death, discontinuation, or End of Study. Visit
  Frequency: Every week in the first 2 cycles, followed by every 3 weeks in the subsequent
  cycles. An End of Treatment Visit and Safety Follow-up/Discontinuation Visit are
  scheduled after the treatment period.'
