summary: The main goals of this study are to learn about the safety of sacituzumab
  tirumotecan with bevacizumab and if people tolerate it; and If people who take sacituzumab
  tirumotecan with or without bevacizumab live longer without the cancer getting worse
  than those who receive standard of care treatment.
