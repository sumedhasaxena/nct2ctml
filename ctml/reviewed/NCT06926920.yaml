summary: 'The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about the study drug sacituzumab
  govitecan-hziy (SG) given at an alternative dose and schedule, in participants with
  triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).


  The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of
  SG given at alternate dose and schedule, to assess the effect on objective response
  rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).'
