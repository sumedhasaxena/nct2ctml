prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Biopsy proven B-NHL, including DLBCL, HGBL, or FL.'
- '* Relapsed/refractory cohorts:'
- In order to be eligible subjects must have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy
  and not be candidates for treatment regimens known to provide clinical benefit in
  B-NHL. CAR T-naive subjects are allowed if they have declined, are considered ineligible
  for, or do not have timely access to CAR T cell therapies.
- '* 1L FL cohorts: Subject has biopsy-proven FL Grade 1-3a per WHO 2016 classification,
  Stage II-IV, FL International Prognostic Index 2-5 that has not been treated with
  prior systemic lymphoma-directed therapy and requires initiation of treatment based
  on GELF criteria. Radiation to localized disease prior to study entry is allowed
  if \>14 days from first dose.'
- '* All Cohorts:'
- "Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of\
  \ \u2264 2."
- "* Subject must have adequate liver, bone marrow and kidney function (eGFR \u2265\
  \ 50 mL/min)."
- '* Subject must have locally confirmed CD19 positivity (must be documented after
  time of progression from last CD19-targeted therapy, if received)'
- '* Subject must have at least 1 measurable disease site'
- '* Subject must have ANC \>/= 1000/mm3, platelets \>/= 50,000 mm3, hemoglobin \>/=
  8.0 g/dL. Transfusion and/or growth factor are allowed but counts must be stable
  for at least 72 hours afterwards prior to screening'
- '* Subject must have a total bilirubin \<1.5x ULN, AST/ALT \< 3xULN'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Subject has been diagnosed with or treated for another malignancy whose
  natural history or treatment may interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment
  of the investigational regimen.
- Exclude - * Subject has active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by their
  B-NHL. --Subjects may be eligible with a distant history of CNS involvement that
  has been adequately treated with no evidence of recurrence within last 6 months
  from screening.
- Exclude - * Subject has a history of leukemic presentation of their B-NHL (\>5,000
  circulating lymphoma cells/uL in the peripheral blood).
- Exclude - * Subject has history or presence of clinically significant CNS pathology
- Exclude - * Subject has CNS involvement from active or history of autoimmune disease.
- Exclude - * Subject received CD19 CAR T therapy within 3 months prior to first dose.
- "Exclude - * Subject experienced Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS)\
  \ following prior T-cell engager (TCE) or CAR T-cell therapy."
- "Exclude - * Subject experienced Grade \u2265 2 neurotoxicity/immune effector cell-associated\
  \ neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following prior TCE or CAR T-cell therapy."
- Exclude - * Subject has received a peripheral autologous stem cell transplant (SCT)
  within 12 weeks, or an allogeneic SCT within 1 year of the first dose of study drug
  treatment or has received an SCT and requires ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.
- Exclude - * Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or subjects
  with chronic or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus
  (HCV). HIV-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable
  viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial. Subjects with chronic HBV
  may be enrolled if the HBV viral load is undetectable on suppressive therapy, or
  if the subject has a documented cure. Subjects with HCV who have a documented cure
  may be enrolled.
- Exclude - * Subject has a history of major cardiac abnormalities.
- Exclude - * If female, subject must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

summary: This phase 1 study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic,
  pharmacodynamic, and clinical activity of AZD0486, a CD19 x CD3 T-cell engaging
  bispecific antibody, in subjects with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

      arm_description: AZD0486 monotherapy will be administered intravenously on day
        1 and 15 of 28 day cycles for a maximum of 2 years or until discontinuation
        criteria are met. Depending on cohort, subjects may receive priming or step-up
        dosing administered weekly during cycle 1 before reaching the target dose.
        Additional cohorts may be opened where subjects receive weekly dosing during
        Cycles 1-2. While on study, subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy
        with periodic disease assessment with PET/CT. If subject achieves two consecutive
        CRs after completing C6, then they may be eligible for monthly dosing
