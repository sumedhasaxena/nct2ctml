prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. 19 to 75 years of age
- 2. A histologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable advanced
  solid tumor patient who has used all available existing standard therapy but tumor
  progression is confirmed and further treatment tool is absent, or patient showing
  resistant or inadequate to standard therapy.

  accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) 1.1
- 6. In screening and C1D1, subjects with appropriate hematologic, kidney, and liver
  function confirmed by the following laboratory test (one more laboratory test is
  permitted during the screening period)
- <!-- -->
- "1. white blood cell (WBC) \u2265 3,500/mm3"

  \ survival period of more than 12 weeks 9) Patients who have recovered from previous\
  \ therapy-related adverse event to Common Terminology Criterion for Adverse Events\
  \ (CTCAE) version 5.0 grade 1 or below or to C1D1 levels (However, sHair loss (regardless\
  \ of grade), subjects can be enrolled if they have with hair loss (regardless of\
  \ grade) or peripheral neuropathy below grade 2 or laboratory test results show\
  \ that they do not meet the exclusion criteria) can be enrolled.) 10) Patients,\
  \ who after understanding all the relevant information of this clinical trial, decides\
  \ to participate, and voluntarily signed a written agreement."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Within 4 weeks prior to the C1D1, subjects who underwent surgery, chemotherapy
  (cytotoxic, targeted antitumor drugs), immunotherapy, biological or hormonal therapy,
  or radiation therapy at areas exceeding 30% of bone marrow for the treatment of
  this clinical trial's target disease
- Exclude - 2. Participation in other interventional clinical trials (administration
  of investigational new drugs or use of investigational medical devices) within 4
  weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - 3. Subjects who are identified with the following comorbidities during
  screening
- Exclude - \- Clinically significant symptomatic or uncontrolled central nervous
  system metastasis (but can participate in this clinical trial if systemic corticosteroids
  have not been administered for more than 2 weeks prior to C1D1 and the condition
  is stable)
- Exclude - * Heart disease that could affect this clinical trial (left ventricular
  ejection fraction (LVEF) \<50%, congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association
  (NYHA) class II or higher, history of myocarditis, myocardial infarction or unstable
  angina within 24 weeks before C1D1, uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmia by appropriate
  medication, coronary artery disease, etc.)
- Exclude - * History of thrombosis (e.g., thrombophlebitis, etc.)
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \> 160 mmHg or diastolic
  blood pressure \> 100 mmHg)
- Exclude - * Clinically significant ascites
- 'Exclude - * Subjects who are infected with or carrying hepatitis B virus (HBV)
  or hepatitis C virus (HCV)\* \* When screening, serology tests show that any one
  of the following is positive: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
  antibody-immunoglobulin M (HBcAb-IgM), and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) (However,
  if the HCV Ab test result is suspected to be false positive or positive due to past
  infection, HCV RNA test may be performed at each institution under the judgement
  of investigator and the HCV Ab and RNA test results are integrated to decide whether
  HCV is infected.)'
- Exclude - 4. The following medical history is identified during screening
- Exclude - * Chickenpox or varicella zoster infection within 12 weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled active infectious diseases including known human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV) positives
- Exclude - 5. Subjects with a history of administration of the following drugs during
  screening or C1D1
- Exclude - * Vaccination against yellow fever within 4 weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - * Penitoin within 1 week prior to C1D1
- Exclude - * G-CSF administration to correct absolute neutrophil count (ANC) levels
  within 2 weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - \-- Transfusion of packed red cells or platelets to correct platelets
  or hemoglobin levels within 2 weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - * Trastuzumab within 28 weeks prior to C1D1
- Exclude - 6. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and fertile women with plan for pregnancy
- Exclude - 7. Fertile women or men who do not agree to abstain from sex or perform
  effective contraception methods for at least 24 weeks after the end of administration\*

  \ on investigator's judgment, thorough abstinence from sex is approved if the subject's\
  \ age, occupation, lifestyle, or sexual orientation guarantee contraception. However,\
  \ periodic abstinence (menstrual cycle, mucus method, symptomatic body temperature\
  \ method, etc.), resection, and withdrawal method (coitus interruptus) are not recognized\
  \ as appropriate contraception methods."
- Exclude - 8. Subjects who have a history of allergies to doxorubicin or the excipient
  of MPD-1 or is suspicious of allergy
- Exclude - 9. Subjects in a state of prohibiting, limiting, or disrupting the assessments
  specified in the clinical trial (e.g., a history of alcohol or drug abuse within
  two years prior to C1D1)
- Exclude - 10. Subjects considered as unsuitable for participation in the clinical
  trial by the investigator (e.g., if the patient's health is unsuitable or participation
  in this clinical trial is not the best treatment for the patient)
