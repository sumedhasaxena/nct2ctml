summary: "This clinical trial is studying solid tumor cancers. A solid tumor is one\
  \ that starts in part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood.\
  \ Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're\
  \ harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.\n\nParticipants\
  \ in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have\
  \ tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or\
  \ spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic\
  \ solid tumors that express HER2.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug\
  \ called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate\
  \ or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.\n\nThis clinical\
  \ trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in\
  \ the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand\
  \ name TUKYSA\xAE.\n\nThis study will test how safe and how well DV with tucatinib\
  \ works for participants with solid tumors. This study will also test what side\
  \ effects happen when participants take these drugs. A side effect is anything a\
  \ drug does to the body besides treating the disease."
