- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Have prior chemotherapy regimen other than first line gemcitabine
  and cisplatin-based therapy for unresectable metastatic or locally advanced BTC
  Note: prior fluoropyrimidine base (including capecitabine, carmofur (HCFU), doxifluridine,
  fluorouracil (5-FU), and tegafur) chemotherapy (including fluoropyrimidine monotherapy

  toxicity or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or hypersensitivity, allergic reaction,
  or intolerance
- Exclude - 4. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to capecitabine, tegafur, gimeracil,
  oteracil potassium, oxaliplatin or other platinum compounds, leucovorin products,

  \ \u2264 28 days prior to the date of enrollment."
- Exclude - 7. Under flucytosine treatment.
- "Exclude - 8. Residual toxicity from prior chemotherapy or CCRT that is Grade \u2265\
  2 (residual Grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are permitted)"
- Exclude - 9. Any GI disorder which would significantly impede absorption of an oral

- Exclude - 14. Have documented cerebrovascular disease. Subjects with the disease
  may be excluded, but if the investigator assesses that they are asymptomatic or
  well controlled could be enrolled.
