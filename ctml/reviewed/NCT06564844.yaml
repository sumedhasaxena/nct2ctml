summary: This is a Phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, global study assessing
  the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Dato-DXd in combination with rilvegostomig compared
  with SoC, after complete surgical resection (R0) in participants with Stage I adenocarcinoma
  NSCLC who are ctDNA-positive, as determined by the Sponsor-designated ctDNA assay,
  or have at least one high-risk pathological feature.
