summary: This study is open-label, multi-center, prospective study, which targets
  childhood patients with relapsed acute lymphostatic leukemia including bone marrow
  recurrence. Aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of NGS MRD based risk
  stratified treatment for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents.
