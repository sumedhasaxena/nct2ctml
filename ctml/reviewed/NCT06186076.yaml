prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Patients with ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1
- 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory,
  locally unresectable advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR mutation
- '3. Failed standard of care treatments progressed after anti tumor treatments including
  at least 1 approved EGFR TKI \[Phase2: TKIs should include the approved EGFR TKIs
  with activity against T790M (e.g., osimertinib)\]'
- 4. Slots may be reserved for patients with certain resistant mutations (i.e., EGFR
  C797X mutation with or without T790M mutation as required by the sponsor) \[Phase
  1\]
- 5. EGFR C797X mutation with or without T790M mutation \[Phase 2\]
- 6. Not received more than 1 prior line of platinum based chemotherapy in the metastatic
  setting \[Phase 2\]
- 7. Having at least 1 measurable tumor lesion per RECIST v1.1 criteria \[Phase 2\]
- 8. Having adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function as specified in the
  protocol
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. NSCLC with mixed cell histology or a tumor with histologic transformation
  of small cell elements
- Exclude - 2. Patients having tumor with any additional known driver of alterations
- Exclude - 3. Patients with presence of another active primary malignant tumor that
  has been diagnosed or required therapy within 2 years prior to the initiation of
  the study treatment
- Exclude - 4. Patients who have unstable and symptomatic primary CNS tumors/metastasis,
  leptomeningeal metastases or spinal cord compression which are not suitable for
  enrollment, as judged by the Investigator
- Exclude - 5. Patients having clinically active ongoing ILD of any etiology
- Exclude - 6. Clinically significant cardiac conditions, infections, refractory GI
  diseases as specified in the protocol
- Exclude - 7. Patients having any unresolved toxicities from prior anti tumor therapy
  and surgery greater than CTCAE Grade 1 at the time of starting the study treatment
- 'Exclude - 8. Recent anticancer therapy: EGFR-TKI, Immunotherapy or any other systemic
  anticancer therapy or radiotherapy (specific duration prior to starting study medication
  per protocol)'

summary: This is a Phase 1/2, open-label study designed to investigate the safety,
  tolerability, PK, and anti-tumor activity of the study treatment in the treatment
  of patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC, who progressed following prior standard treatments
  which include the approved EGFR-TKIs with activity against T790M (e.g., osimertinib).
