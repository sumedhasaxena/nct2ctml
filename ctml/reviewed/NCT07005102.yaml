prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 during
  the screening period and prior to dosing of study treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1.'
- '* Must consent to provide recently obtained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
  tumor tissue (ideally collected during or after locally advanced or metastatic diagnosis)
  or archived tissue during screening for c-Met immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing
  and study stratification. c-Met IHC results are required prior to randomization.'
- '* Must have at least one non-irradiated measurable disease per Response Evaluation
  Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. If only one measurable lesion exists,
  it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as it has not been previously
  irradiated and as long as it has not been biopsied within 14 days of the baseline
  tumor assessment scans.'
- '* Any toxicities from prior systemic anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to
  common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or baseline level
  (except for alopecia \[any grade\] or Grade \<= 2 peripheral neuropathy).'
- '* Should not have any major, life-threatening conditions and life expectancy as
  determined by the investigator should be at least 3 months.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * History of interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonitis that required
  treatment with systemic steroids, or any evidence of active ILD/pneumonitis on screening
  chest computed tomography (CT) scan.
- Exclude - * History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g.,
  bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Participants has leptomeningeal disease, or subject has spinal cord
  compression not definitively treated with surgery or radiation.
- Exclude - * History of any malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative
  intent and with no known active disease present for 2 years before the first dose
  of study treatment and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by investigator, successfully
  treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

summary: 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common type of lung cancer where
  abnormal cells in the lungs grow out of control. The purpose of this study is to
  assess adverse events and change in disease activity when telisotuzumab adizutecan
  is given in combination with a fixed dose of osimertinib (Osi), Osi alone, or standard
  of care (SOC) alone.


  Telisotuzumab adizutecan is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment
  of NSCLC. Osi is a drug approved for the treatment of NSCLC. This study will be
  divided into two stages, in the first stage participants will receive increasing
  doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with Osi. Participants will then be randomized
  into 4 groups called treatment arms where 3 groups will receive 1 of 3 optimized
  doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan from the dose escalation phase with Osi, or Osi
  alone. In the second stage participants will receive the optimal dose of telisotuzumab
  adizutecan, from the previous stage, with Osi, or SOC. Approximately 694 adult participants
  with mCRC will be enrolled in the study in 200 sites worldwide.


  In Stage 1, during dose escalation participants will receive increasing intravenous
  (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with oral Osi tablets. During dose optimization
  participants will receive OSi alone or with 1 of 3 optimized doses of telisotuzumab
  adizutecan. In stage 2 participnats will recieve the optimal dose of IV telisotuzumab
  adizutecanin with oral Osi tablet, or SOC. The study will run for a duration of
  approximately 76 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
