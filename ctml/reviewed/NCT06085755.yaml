summary: "Despite recent advances, the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric\
  \ cancer remains poor. At present, regimens that combine a platinum and fluorouracil\
  \ agent either alone or in combination with a third drug such as epirubicin or taxane\
  \ constitute the most effective treatment option in the first-line metastatic setting,\
  \ resulting in a median OS of approximately 10 months. In the second-line setting,\
  \ ramucirumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antagonist) was recently\
  \ approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and has demonstrated\
  \ modest activity in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who progressed\
  \ after first-line platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Median\
  \ OS was 5.2 months in the ramucirumab group versus 3.8 months in the placebo group.\n\
  \nAt the updated DCO of 03 June 2020 in the DS8201-A-J202 (DESTINY-Gastric01) study\
  \ in HER2-positive GC or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects assigned to T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg,\
  \ T-DXd further demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy. The median OS was 12.5\
  \ months for the T-DXd group and 8.9 months for the physician's choice group (HR\
  \ = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.86). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, the percentages\
  \ of patients with an objective response were analyzed in HER2-low group. The response\
  \ rate in HER2 2+ was 29% (8 of 28) with T-DXd monotherapy.\n\nRefer to the figure\
  \ below for the response rate in HER2-low group in previous DESTINY trials.\n\n\
  This is a two part, phase I/\u2161, open-label, single center study of afatinib\
  \ in combination with T-DXd, in 2L/3L gastric cancer patients with HER2-low. The\
  \ study design allows an investigation of combination dose of afatinib with T-DXd,\
  \ with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients."
