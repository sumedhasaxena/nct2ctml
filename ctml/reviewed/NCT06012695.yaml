summary: NBM-BMX is an orally available new chemical entity to inhibit histone deacetylases
  8 (HDAC8) activity specifically, being developed as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic
  by NatureWise. This study aims to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary
  efficacy of NBM-BMX as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors or combination
  with the standard of care treatment in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
