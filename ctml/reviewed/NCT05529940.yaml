  a study subject C. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by histological examination
  (histologic or cytopathological) D. Patients evaluated as resectable pancreatic
  cancer in preoperative imaging as follows (NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma

  function
- "1. Bone marrow function: WBC 3,000/mm3 or more or ANC 1,500/mm3 or more, platelet\
  \ \u2265 100K/mm3"
- "2. Liver function: Bilirubin \u2264 3 x upper normal limit (\u22645.0 mg/dL), AST/ALT\

- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - \- Patients who met any of the following criteria are not eligible to
  participate in this study.
- Exclude - A. Those evaluated as borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic
  cancer in preoperative imaging examination (The resectability assessment depends
  on the presence of major vessel invasion, while invasion of adjacent organs is excluded
  from the criteria) B. Patients with a history of previous pancreatic surgery C.

  cancer D. Patients with distant metastases or recurrent pancreatic cancer E. Pancreatic
  body or tail cancer requiring combined resection of adjacent organs (stomach or
  kidney) (except for the adrenal gland) F. Patients within five years of diagnosis
  of other organ malignancies (with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma
  skin cancer and carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease) G. Pregnant and lactating
  women H. Serious concomitant systemic disorders, including active or ongoing systemic
  infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, clinically significant
  cardiac arrhythmias, psychiatric disorders, or uncontrolled comorbid conditions
  that may limit compliance with study requirements, or any medical condition that,
  at the discretion of the investigator, could compromise patient safety, interfere
  with the assessment of safety and efficacy, or hinder participation in the clinical
  trial.

summary: 'Rationale: Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery significantly improved the
  survival of PC patients, but there is a problem that only about 50% of patients
  start adjuvant chemotherapy after pancreatectomy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy might
  control potential metastatic lesion which are not being detected in early diseases
  status and improve the R0 resection rate. In addition, it prevents futile surgery
  by selecting patients with rapid progression of disease. Furthermore, compared to
  chemotherapy administered after surgery, more patients can complete the planned
  chemotherapy schedule in neoadjuvant setting. Asians differ from Westerners not
  only in racial differences, but also in average size and body surface area. Accordingly,
  there is an urgent need for clinical studies on the dose, toxicity, dosing cycle,
  and efficacy of anticancer drugs that reflect actual clinical trials in Asian countries
  for Asians. There are still few studies worldwide that prospectively explored the
  efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable PC and the administration of
  neoadjuvant therapy in resectable PC depends on individual clinical judgment. Therefore,
  systematic and prospective clinical trials are essential to standardize treatment
  protocol in resectable PC.


  Obective: To investigate whether 6 cycles of preoperative mFOLFIRINOX - surgery
  - 6 cycles of postoperative mFOLFIRINOX improves overall survival by intention-to-treat
  compared to surgery followed by 12 cycles of postoperative mFOLFIRINOX.


  Study design: open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial Study
  population: Patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and ECOG performance 0 or
  1.
