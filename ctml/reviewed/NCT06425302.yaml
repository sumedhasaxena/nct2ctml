- Inclusion Criteria
- '* Participant has histologically confirmed Grade 1, 2 or 3a follicular lymphoma

- A. A nodal or extra nodal (except spleen) mass \> 7cm in its greater diameter or,
  involvement of at least 3 nodal or extra nodal sites (each with a diameter greater
  than \>3 cm).
- ii) Presence of at least one of the following B symptoms:.
- "A. Fever (\\>38\xB0C) of unclear etiology."
- B. Night sweats.
- C. Weight loss greater than 10% within the prior 6 months.
- iii) Splenomegaly with inferior margin below the umbilical line.
- iv) Any one of the following cytopenia due to lymphoma:.
- A. Platelets \<100,000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L).
- B. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1,000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L).
- C. Hemoglobin \< 10g/dL (6.25 mmol/L).
- v) Pleural or peritoneal serous effusion (irrespective of cell content).
- vi) Any compressive syndrome (for example, but not restricted to ureteral, orbital,
  gastrointestinal).
- Exclude - Exclusion Criteria
- Exclude - * Clinical evidence of transformed lymphoma by investigator assessment.
- Exclude - * Follicular Large Cell as per WHO 5th classification or Grade 3b follicular
  lymphoma as per WHO 4th classification.
- Exclude - * Participant has any significant medical condition, active infection,
  laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the participation
  in the study.
- Exclude - * Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
