- "* Women and Men, \u226518 years at the time of screening (or per national guidelines)"
- '* Histologically confirmed ER+/HER2- early-stage resected invasive breast cancer
  with high or intermediate risk of recurrence, based on clinical-pathological risk
  features, as defined in the protocol.'
- '* Completed adequate (definitive) locoregional therapy (surgery with or without
  radiotherapy) for the primary breast tumour(s), with or without (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy'
- '* Completed at least 2 years but no more than 5 years (+3 months) of adjuvant ET
  (+/- CDK4/6 inhibitor)'
- "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u2264 1"
- '* Adequate organ and marrow function'
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- '* Inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer'
- '* Pathological complete response following treatment with neoadjuvant therapy'
- '* History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
  situ of the cervix or considered at very low risk of recurrence per investigator
  judgement) unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of 5 years
  from the date of randomisation'
- '* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the investigator''s
  opinion precludes participation in the study or compliance'
- "* Known LVEF \\<50% with heart failure NYHA Grade \u22652."
- '* Mean resting QTcF interval \>480 ms at screening'
- '* Concurrent exogenous reproductive hormone therapy or non-topical hormonal therapy
  for non-cancer-related conditions'
- '* Any concurrent anti-cancer treatment not specified in the protocol with the exception
  of bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) or RANKL inhibitors (eg, denosumab)'
- '* Previous treatment with camizestrant, investigational SERDs/investigational ER
  targeting agents, or fulvestrant'
- '* Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive serum pregnancy test) or breastfeeding'
- '* Patients with known hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of camizestrant
  or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to camizestrant. In pre-/peri-menopausal
  female and male patients, known hypersensitivity or intolerance to LHRH agonists,
  that would preclude the patient from receiving any LHRH agonist'

summary: This is a Phase III open-label study to assess if camizestrant improves outcomes
  compared to standard endocrine therapy in patients with ER+/HER2 - early breast
  cancer with intermediate or high risk for disease recurrence who completed definitive
  locoregional therapy (with or without chemotherapy) and standard adjuvant endocrine
  therapy (ET) for at least 2 years and up to 5 years. The planned duration of treatment
  in either arm of the study is 60 months.
