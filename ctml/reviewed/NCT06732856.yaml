summary: 'Claudin 18.2 is a promising therapeutic target overexpressed on the surface
  of gastric cancer cells. The addition of zolbetuximab, the monoclonal antibody targeting
  Claudin 18.2 to chemotherapy in two recent Phase 3 studies prolonged survival outcomes,
  indicating that Claudin 18.2 is a valid target in gastric cancer. Asan Medical Center
  researchers conducted a study on Claudin 18.2 expression in patients with operable
  gastric cancer and defined moderate to strong claudin expression in more than 75%
  of tumor cells as Claudin 18.2 overexpression, which was observed in 46.5% of patients
  with stage I-III tumors. This suggests that zolbetuximab-based treatment may be
  possible in patients with LAGC.


  Therefore, The investigator designed a prospective, multicenter, open-label, Phase
  Ib/II study to determine the efficacy and safety of zolbetuximab/DOS as neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy in patients with LAGC.'
