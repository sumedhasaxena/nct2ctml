- 'The main inclusion criteria include, but are not limited to the following:'
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* For aggressive B-cell malignancies mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): Has histologically
  confirmed biopsy according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification
  of neoplasms of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues and has relapsed or refractory
  disease after at least 2 prior systemic therapies including a Bruton''s tyrosine
  kinase inhibition/inhibitor(s) (BTKi), and is post chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)
  cell therapy or is ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy.'

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of zilovertamab
  vedotin as monotherapy and in combination in participants with select B-cell lymphomas
  including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Richter''s transformation lymphoma (RTL),
  follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study will
  also evaluate zilovertamab vedotin as monotherapy and in combination with respect
  to objective response rate.


  * Cohort A: Participants with relapsed or refractory MCL relapsed or refractory
  disease after at least 2 prior systemic therapies including a Bruton''s tyrosine
  kinase inhibition/inhibitor (BTKi), and post therapy chimeric antigen receptor T
  (CAR-T) cell therapy or ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy

  * Cohort B: Participants with relapsed or refractory RT disease after at least 1
  prior systemic therapy

  * Cohort C: Participants with relapsed or refractory MCL relapsed or refractory
  disease after at least 1 prior systemic therapy and no prior exposure to a non-covalent
  BTKi

  * Cohort D: Participants with relapsed or refractory FL and CLL relapsed or refractory
  disease after at least 2 prior systemic therapies and have no other available therapy

  * Cohort E: Participants with relapsed or refractory FL after at least 2 prior systemic
  therapies and have no other available therapy


  The primary study hypothesis is that zilovertamab vedotin monotherapy has an increased
  Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Lugano Response Criteria as assessed by blinded
  independent central review (BICR).


  As of Amendment 07, Cohort D is closed to enrollment of participants with CLL and
  enrollment of participants into Arm 2 (zilovertamab vedotin at Dose 2 on Days 1
  \& 8 of each 3 Week Cycle (Q2/3W)).'
