summary: 'This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study
  in participants with advanced liver cancers. The study is designed with the flexibility
  to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment
  arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, modify
  the participant population, or introduce additional cohorts of participants with
  other types of advanced primary liver cancer.


  Cohort 1 will enroll participants with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease.
  Eligible participants will initially be randomly assigned to one of several treatment
  arms (Stage 1). Participants who experience loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable
  toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to receive treatment with a different treatment
  combination (Stage 2). When a Stage 2 treatment combination is available, this will
  be introduced by amending the protocol.'
