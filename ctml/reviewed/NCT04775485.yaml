summary: This is a Phase 2, multi center, open-label study to evaluate the safety
  and efficacy of Type II RAF (tovorafenib) in pediatric participants with low-grade
  glioma or advanced solid tumors. Qualifying genomic alterations will be identified
  through molecular assays as routinely performed at Clinical Laboratory Improvement
  Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 or other similarly certified laboratories prior to enrollment
  into any of the arms. The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment
  period, a long-term extension phase, end of treatment (EOT) visit(s), a safety follow-up
  visit, and long-term follow-up assessments.
