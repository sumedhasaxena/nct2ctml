  (RECIST) v.1.1.'
- '* Subjects must have histologically/cytologically confirmed gastric or gastroesophageal
  cancer that is metastatic (Stage 4) or unresectable (Stage 3).'
- '* Subjects must have received at least 1-2 prior lines of locally available standard
  therapies or must be intolerant of standard therapies.'
- "* For subjects in escalation: If prior Claudin 18 IHC expression is known, the\

  \ or have expression \u2265 1% of tumor cells IHC \u2265 2+. Consult with Medical\
  \ Monitor as needed."
- '* Adequate organ function'
- '* Agree to have a biopsy prior to enrollment, at acceptable risk in the judgement
  of the Investigator. If a biopsy is not safely accessible or clinically feasible,
  an adequate archival tumor sample must be submitted.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases except for disease that
  is asymptomatic, clinically stable, and has not required steroids for at least 14
  days before starting study treatment.
- Exclude - * Cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, or hepatic disease
- Exclude - * Active infection
- Exclude - * History of inflammatory eye disease
- Exclude - * Residual toxicity from a previous treatment
- Exclude - * Any investigational agent or standard anti-cancer therapies within 28
