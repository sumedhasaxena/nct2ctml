- 2. has confirmed HER2-positive expression as determined according to American Society
  of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists guidelines evaluated at
  a central laboratory
- 3. was previously treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)
- '* Has documented radiologic progression (during or after most recent treatment
  or within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy)'
- '* Is HER2 positive as confirmed by central laboratory assessment of most recent
  tumor tissue sample available. If archived tissue is not available, agrees to provide
  a fresh biopsy.'

- '* Has adequate hematopoietic, renal and hepatic functions'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has previously participated in an antibody drug conjugate study sponsored

  therapy
- Exclude - * Has had prior treatment with capecitabine
- Exclude - * Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease
- Exclude - * Has a history of (noninfectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
