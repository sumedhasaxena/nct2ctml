summary: "B-cell Lymphoma is an aggressive and rare cancer of a type of immune cell\
  \ (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). The purpose of this\
  \ study is to assess the safety and tolerability of epcoritamab in combination with\
  \ anti-neoplastic agents in adult participants with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\
  \ Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.\n\nEpcoritamab\
  \ is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NHL. Study doctors\
  \ put the participants in groups called treatment arms. The combination of epcoritamab\
  \ with anti-neoplastic agents will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different\
  \ treatment combination depending on eligibility. Approximately 565 adult participants\
  \ with NHL will be enrolled in 100 sites globally.\n\nIn both the dose escalation\
  \ and dose expansion arms participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) epcoritamab\
  \ in 28 day, 21 day, or 56 day cycles dependent on the arm in combination with the\
  \ anti-neoplastic agents described below:\n\n1: Oral lenalidomide in participants\
  \ (PPTS) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); 2:\
  \ Oral ibrutinib and oral lenalidomide in PPTS with with R/R DLBCL; 3: Intravenous\
  \ (IV) polatuzumab vedotin, IV rituximab, IV cyclophosphamide, IV doxorubicin hydrochloride\
  \ (HCl), and oral prednisone (pola-R-CHP) in PPTS with newly diagnosed treatment-na\xEF\
  ve DLBCL; 4: Oral CC-99282 in PPTS with R/R DLBCL; 5: Oral CC-99282 in PPTS with\
  \ R/R follicular lymphoma (FL); 6A: Oral ibrutinib in PPTS with R/R mantle cell\
  \ lymphoma (MCL); 6B: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in PPTS with R/R MCL;\
  \ 7: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in PPTS with newly diagnosed treatment-na\xEF\
  ve MCL. 8: Oral pirtobrutinib in PPTS with R/R MCL.\n\nThere may be higher treatment\
  \ burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants\
  \ will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital\
  \ or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical\
  \ assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects."
