summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BMS-986504,
  a selective, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, in combination with Nab-paclitaxel/Gemcitabine
  (nab-p/gem) versus placebo in combination with nab-p/gem, in participants with untreated
  metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with homozygous methylthioadenosine
  phosphorylase (MTAP) deletion.
