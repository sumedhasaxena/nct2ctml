summary: 'RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
  Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy can
  fight prostate cancer by androgen deprivation. It is not yet known if neoadjuvant
  radiation therapy is a more effective therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.


  PURPOSE: Two-stage randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant
  radiotherapy and hormone therapy followed by radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk
  locally advanced prostate cancer'
