  underlying malignancy except those who have been treated and have stable CNS metastases
  or are asymptomatic.
- Exclude - 5. AIDS-defining opportunistic infections within the past 12 months.
- Exclude - 6. HBV infection (positive HBsAg) except for carrier of inactive HBV as
  defined by negative HBeAg with normal ALT and HBV DNA \< 2,000 IU/mL or HCV infection

- 'Exclude - 7. Inadequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic or renal function as defined
  by any of the following laboratory values:'

  with prior treatment with prophylactic drug)
- Exclude - 13. If female, is pregnant or breastfeeding
- Exclude - 14. If men or women with childbearing potential, unwilling to use effective
  contraceptive methods during the study and for at least 3 months (men) or 1 month

  implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs),
  sexual abstinence, surgical sterilization, or a partner who is sterile.
- Exclude - 15. Receiving live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first
  dose of study drug.

summary: The study drug TRX-920 Oral Gel contains SN38, an active metabolite of Irinotecan
  (CPT-11), which is a widely prescribed anti-cancer drug that has been approved in
  many countries for the treatment of colorectal and pancreatic cancer. TRX-920 is
  the oral gel formulation that directly contains SN38 instead of Irinotecan. A series
  of biology and animal studies have demonstrated that the TRX-920 Oral Gel could
  inhibit tumor growth with fewer side effects compared to Irinotecan.
