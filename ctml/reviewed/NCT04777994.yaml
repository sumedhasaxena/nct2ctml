summary: 'The study will assess the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of ABBVCLS-484
  as monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 targeting agent or with a or a vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).


  The trial aims to establish a safe, tolerable, and efficacious dose of ABBVCLS-484
  as monotherapy and in combination. The study will be conducted in three parts. Part
  1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Part 2 Combination Dose Escalation and Part 3 Dose
  Expansion (Monotherapy and Combination therapy).


  Part 1, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone in escalating dose levels to eligible
  subjects who have advanced solid tumors.


  Part 2, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered at escalating dose levels in combination
  with a PD-1 targeting agent or with a VEGFR TKI to eligible subjects who have advanced
  solid tumors.


  Part 3, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone as a monotherapy at the determined
  recommended dose in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, relapsed or refractory
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), relapsed or refractory non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
  ABBV-CLS-484 will also be administered at the determined recommended dose in combination
  with a PD-1 targeting or with a VEGFR TKI agent in subjects with locally advanced
  or metastatic, HNSCC, NSCLC, MSI-H tumors refractory to PD-1/PD-L1, and advanced
  ccRCC.'
