  \ phase (I) and the dose-expansion phase (II).\n\nSubjects will receive a weekly\
  \ single dose of HCB101 IV infusion over 60 (\xB110) minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15\
  \ in each 21-day cycle in combination with Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV day 1; given\
  \ every 14 days) /Cetuximab (500 mg/m2 IV day 1; given every 14 days) , and FOLFIRI/FOLFOX\
  \ until unacceptable AE(s), radiographic or clinically documented disease progression,\
