- Exclude - 5. History of previous malignancy within five years prior to inclusion,
  that affects ovarian cancer treatment results, with the exception of carcinoma in
  situ, radically excised basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin, or synchronal
  endometrial carcinoma FIGO IA G1/2,
- Exclude - 6. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia

  meningitis or patients who have been previously treated for brain metastases must
  be in a stable state in radiology,
- Exclude - 8. Patients with antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral infections requiring
  systemic treatment (administration of parenteral antibiotics),
- Exclude - 9. Active tuberculosis that is not controlled within 1 month of treatment,
- Exclude - 10. Patients diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder or substance abuse
  disorder that would interfere with your ability to cooperate with the trial,
- Exclude - 11. Patients with any contraindications to the use of cisplatin (i.e.,
  hypersensitivity to cisplatin),

  or bone marrow transplantation or a history of double umbilical cord transplantation
  or,
- Exclude - 13. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
  abnormality that may confound the results of the study, or interfere with the patient's
  participation, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
