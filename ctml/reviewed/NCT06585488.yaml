summary: 'This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter, dose escalation
  and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
  (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-53038 as monotherapy
  in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations
  or amplification, as well as when used in combination with tislelizumab (also known
  as BGB-A317) in participants with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  and used in combination with cetuximab in participants with colorectal cancer (CRC).
  The study consists of 2 phases: Phase 1a Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion and
  Phase 1b Dose Expansion.'
