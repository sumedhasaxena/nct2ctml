- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for randomization
  into the study:'
- "1. Participants aged \u226518 years (follow local regulatory requirements if the\
  \ legal age of consent for study participation is \\>18 years old)."
- 2. Has histologically or cytologically documented unresectable locally advanced
  or metastatic ESCC according to American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition staging
  system on ESCC.
- 3. Has disease progression post a platinum-based chemotherapy and an ICI treatment
  per global or local guidelines, with a maximum of 1 prior line of systemic therapy
  for unresectable advanced or metastatic ESCC.
- 4. The participant must provide adequate baseline tumor samples with sufficient
  quantity and quality of tumor tissue content as defined in the Laboratory Manual.
- 5. Has at least 1 measurable lesion on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator. Measurable
  lesions should not be from a previously irradiated site. If the lesion at a previously
  irradiated site is the only selectable target lesion, a radiological assessment
  showing significant progression of the irradiated lesion should be provided by the
  investigator.
- 6. Has an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified
  from entering the study:'
- Exclude - 1. Has received prior treatment with orlotamab, enoblituzumab, or other
  B7-H3 targeted agents, including I-DXd.
- Exclude - 2. Has received any topoisomerase inhibitor.
- Exclude - 3. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenosquamous carcinoma
  subtype.
- Exclude - 4. Is ineligible to all the chemotherapies in the comparator arm due to
  prior progression or intolerance.
- Exclude - 5. Has tumor invasion into organs located adjacent to the esophageal disease
  site (eg, aorta or respiratory tract) at an increased risk of bleeding or fistula
  as assessed by the investigator.
- Exclude - 6. Clinically active brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal
  carcinomatosis, defined as untreated or symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids
  or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. Subjects with clinically inactive
  or treated brain metastases who are asymptomatic (ie, without neurologic signs or
  symptoms and not requiring treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants) may
  be included in the study. Subjects must have a stable neurologic status and discontinue
  corticosteroid usage for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.
- 'Exclude - 7. Has any of the following within the past 6 months: cerebrovascular
  accident, transient ischemic attack, other arterial thromboembolic event, or pulmonary
  embolism.'
- Exclude - 8. Has a clinically significant corneal disease.
- Exclude - 9. Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
  that required corticosteroids, current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis
  that cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.
- "Exclude - 10. Has clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent\
  \ pulmonary illnesses, including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder\
  \ (ie, pulmonary emboli within 3 months of the study randomization, severe asthma,\
  \ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\[COPD\\], restrictive lung disease, pleural\
  \ effusion, etc), and potential pulmonary involvement caused by any autoimmune,\
  \ connective tissue, or inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\xF6\
  gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, etc), prior pneumonectomy, or requirement for supplemental\
  \ oxygen."
- Exclude - 11. Is on chronic steroid treatment (dose of 10 mg daily or more prednisone
  equivalent), except for low-dose inhaled steroids (for asthma/COPD), topical steroids
  (for mild skin conditions), or intra-articular steroid injections.

summary: This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ifinatamab deruxtecan
  (I-DXd) in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have experienced disease progression following treatment
  with a platinum-based systemic therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)
  compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC).
