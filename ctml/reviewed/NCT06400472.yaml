summary: The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, LY4170156,
  is safe, tolerable and effective in participants with advanced solid tumors. The
  study is conducted in two parts - phase Ia (dose-escalation, dose-optimization)
  and phase Ib (dose-expansion). The study will last up to approximately 4 years.
