summary: 'Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause
  of cancer mortality worldwide, with poor survival prospects for metastatic disease.
  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and
  efficacy of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab plus chemotherapy versus
  pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in participants with untreated metastatic non-squamous
  non-small cell lung cancer.


  Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NSCLC.
  There are 2 stages to this study. In Stage 1, there are 4 treatment arms. Participants
  will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab
  (another investigational drug) + chemotherapy, budigalimab +chemotherapy, or pembrolizumab
  +chemotherapy. In Stage 2, there are 2 treatments arms. Participants will either
  receive livmoniplimab (optimized dose) in combination with budigalimab +chemotherapy
  or placebo in combination with pembrolizumab +chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consists
  of IV Infused pemetrexed + IV infused cisplatin or IV infused or injected carboplatin.
  Approximately 840 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 200 sites
  worldwide.


  Stage 1: In cohort 1, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab
  (dose A)+ IV infused budigalimab, + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab
  + budigalimab + IV Infused pemetrexed. In cohort 2, participants will receive livmoniplimab
  (dose B) + budigalimab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab + budigalimab
  + pemetrexed. In cohort 3, participants will receive budigalimab + chemotherapy
  for 4 cycles followed by budigalimab + pemetrexed . In cohort 4, participants will
  receive IV Infused pembrolizumab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab
  + pemetrexed. Stage 2: In arm 1, participants will receive livmoniplimab (dose optimized)
  + budigalimab + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by livmoniplimab + budigalimab
  + pemetrexed. In arm 2, participants will receive IV Infused placebo + pembrolizumab
  + chemotherapy for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab + pemetrexed. The estimated
  study duration is 55 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests,
  questionnaires, and scans.'
