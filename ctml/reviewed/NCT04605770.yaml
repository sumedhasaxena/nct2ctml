summary: 'Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is rare malignancy of mesodermal origin, representing
  less than 1% of all malignant neoplasms. They are a group of diseases encompassing
  diverse histological subtypes with very different biomorphologies, prognoses, and
  responses to treatments. At advanced stages of STS, anticancer treatments are less
  effective and the prognosis is poor with a median survival of 8 to 18 months. Doxorubicin
  and ifosfamide given each alone or in their combination have represented the mainstream
  of anticancer treatments in metastatic STS. However, salvage treatments for patients
  with progression after doxorubicin/ifosfamide-based treatment are limited and anticancer
  agents such as gemcitabine/docetaxel, pazopanib, eribulin and trabectedin are currently
  used as a standard of care (SOC).


  For metastatic sarcoma, a study of pemetrexed alone in patients with refractory
  STS who have progressed after doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide-based anticancer treatment
  was conducted. In this study including 48 patients, most of whom had relatively
  poor course of disease with disease progression after the 2nd- and/or 3rd-line treatment,
  pemetrexed was well tolerated and associated with 5% of response rate and 33% of
  3-month progression-free rates suggesting potential antitumor efficacy with good
  tolerability profile with refractory STS.


  However, as conventional agents have showed different efficacy depending on various
  subtypes of STS, a confirmatory study to see clinical utilities of a given regimen
  by subtype is required also for pemetrexed/cisplatin. Therefore, the investigators
  intend to proceed this phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety
  of pemetrexed/cisplatin combination therapy in patients with advanced/metastatic
  STS who received up to two-lines of prior palliative anticancer treatments with
  histological subtype-specific cohorts (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant
  peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and others) in order to provide a basis for a subsequent
  phase 3 study by selecting histological subtype(s) in which the efficacy of study
  regimen is to be proven.'

        and this combination therapy will be continued until Cycle 6. Starting from
        Cycle 7, pemetrexed alone will be administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) as IV infusion
        until disease progression.
