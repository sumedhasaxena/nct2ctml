summary: This randomized phase II trial studies how well surgical removal of the prostate
  and antiandrogen therapy with or without docetaxel work in treating men with newly
  diagnosed prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Androgens
  can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antiandrogen therapy may lessen the
  amount of androgens made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel
  work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
  cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Surgery,
  antiandrogen therapy and docetaxel may work better in treating participants with
  prostate cancer.
