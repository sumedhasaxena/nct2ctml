- Exclude - * Prior systemic anticancer therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the
  locally advanced unresectable or metastatic setting; note that participants may
  have received a maximum of 2 doses of mFOLFOX6 in the locally advanced/unresectable
  or metastatic setting prior to randomization.
- 'Exclude - * Note: May have received chemotherapy for CRC in the adjuvant setting

summary: 'This study is being done to find out if tucatinib with other cancer drugs
  works better than standard of care to treat participants with HER2 positive colorectal
  cancer. This study will also determine what side effects happen when participants
  take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body
  besides treating your disease.


  Participants in this study have colorectal cancer that has spread through the body
  (metastatic) and/or cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable).


  Participants will be assigned randomly to the tucatinib group or standard of care
  group. The tucatinib group will get tucatinib, trastuzumab, and mFOLFOX6. The standard
  of care group will get either:


  * mFOLFOX6 alone,

  * mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab, or

  * mFOLFOX6 with cetuximab mFOLFOX6 is a combination of multiple drugs. All of the
  drugs given in this study are used to treat this type of cancer.'
