- Inclusion Criteria
- '* Confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM).'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG) score of 0, 1, or
  2.'
- '* Received 3 to 6 cycles of an induction therapy that includes a proteasome inhibitor
  (PI) and immunomodulatory (IMiD) \[eg, bortezomib thalidomide and dexamethasone
  (VTd), lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd)\] with or without a CD38
  monoclonal antibody, daratumumab + bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone \[D-VTd\]
  and daratumumab + bortezomib/ lenalidomide/dexamethasone \[D-VRd\]), or VCd / daratumumab
  + bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone \[D-VCd\], and followed by a single
  or tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Post-stem cell transplant
  consolidation is permitted.'
- '* Participants within 12 months (single transplant) or 15 months (tandem transplant)
  from initiation of induction therapy who achieved at least a partial response (PR)
  after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with or without consolidation,
  according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG 2016) criteria.'
- Exclude - Exclusion Criteria
- Exclude - * Progressive disease or clinical relapse (as defined by IMWG response
  criteria) following ASCT with or without consolidation or is not responsive to primary
  therapy.
- Exclude - * Smoldering myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma or nonsecretory myeloma.
- Exclude - * Known central nervous system/meningeal involvement of MM.
- "Exclude - * Prior history of malignancies, other than MM, unless the participant\
  \ has been free of the disease for \u2265 5 years."
- Exclude - * Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
