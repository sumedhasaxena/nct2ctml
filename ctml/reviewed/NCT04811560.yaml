summary: The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s)
  (RP2D\[s\]) of bleximenib in phase 1 Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and to determine the
  safety and tolerability at RP2D in Phase 1 Part 2 (Dose expansion). The purpose
  of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of bleximenib at the
  RP2D.

      arm_description: Participants in Phase 1 Part 1 (dose escalation) will receive
        bleximenib orally. The dose levels will be escalated based on the dose limiting
        toxicities (DLT) evaluation by Study Evaluation Team (SET) until the recommended
        Phase 2 Doses (RP2Ds) have been identified. Participants in Phase 1 Part 2
        (dose expansion) will receive bleximenib orally at the RP2D(s) determined
        in Part 1. In Phase 2 participants will receive bleximenib at the RP2D to
        evaluate anti-leukemia activity and demonstrate acceptable safety at the RP2D(s).
