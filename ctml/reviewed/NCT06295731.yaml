- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic, recurrent
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that is considered incurable by local
  therapies.'
- "* Has tumor PD-L1 expression of CPS \u226520. Tumor tissue must be provided for\
  \ PD-L1 biomarker analysis."
- '* Has human papilloma virus (HPV) testing results for oropharyngeal cancer by p16
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing.'
- '* Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 guidelines.'
- '* Has the primary tumor location of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or
  larynx.'
- '* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive

- Exclude - * Has received prior systemic therapy (eg, prior chemo-, immune-, or biologic
  therapy) for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HNSCC.
- "Exclude - * Prior systemic therapy completed \\>6 months prior to signing informed\
  \ consent is allowed if given as part of multimodal treatment for locoregionally\
  \ advanced disease with curative intent, and no PD/recurrence occurred within 6\
  \ months of its completion. Prior systemic immunotherapy in the locoregionally advanced\

  risk of tumor-associated hemorrhage or uncontrolled tumor pain.
- Exclude - * Current or history of immune-related disease that required systemic
  treatment in past 2 years, except for replacement therapy.
