summary: The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of inavolisib
  as a single-agent and in combination with atezolizumab in participants with phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PIK3CA)-mutated cancers,
  including previously treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
