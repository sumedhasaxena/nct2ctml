summary: 'Researchers want to learn if the study medicines MK-1084 and subcutaneous
  (SC) pembrolizumab can be used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when
  given together. MK-1084 is a targeted therapy for the KRAS G12C mutation.


  The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive MK-1084 with SC pembrolizumab
  live longer without the cancer growing or spreading than in people who receive SC
  pembrolizumab with chemotherapy.'
