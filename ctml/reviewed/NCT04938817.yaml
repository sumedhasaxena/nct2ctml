summary: 'This study is a rolling arm study of investigational agents as monotherapy
  or in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with anti-programmed cell death
  1 (PD-1)/ programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) refractory ES-SCLC in need of second-line
  treatment. This study will have 2 parts: an initial safety lead-in to determine
  safety and tolerability for experimental combinations of investigational agents
  without an established recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) followed by an efficacy evaluation.


  Investigational agents will initiate directly in or be added to the efficacy evaluation
  after an initial evaluation of safety and tolerability of the investigational agent
  has been completed in a separate study or in the safety lead-in of this study. If
  an RP2D for a combination being evaluated in the safety lead-in is established from
  another study, then the efficacy evaluation may begin at the determined RP2D.


  There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.'
