summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of divarasib
  and pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab and pemetrexed and carboplatin or
  cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of adult participants with KRAS G12C-mutated,
  advanced or metastatic non squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
