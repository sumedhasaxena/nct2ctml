  rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS),

  the metastatic setting. Participant must have been diagnosed with left-sided colorectal
  cancer (CRC) (Cohort A and B) and right-sided (Cohort C)and have received or been
  intolerant to standard of care (SoC) fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based

  treatment with mFOLFOX6 according to local regulatory approvals and SoC guidelines'
- '* For Phase 1 dose confirmation cohorts (Cohorts Ph1b-D and Ph1b-E): Participant
  must have evaluable disease. For Phase 2: Participant must have measurable disease
  according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. If only one
  measurable lesion exists, it may be used for the screening biopsy as long as baseline
  tumor assessment scans are performed greater than or equal to (\>=) 7 days after
  the biopsy'
- '* Participant must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
  (PS) 0 or 1'
- '* Participant must have a tumor lesion amenable for biopsy and agree to mandatory
  protocol-defined screening biopsy. Biopsies are required if clinically feasible
  for participants in Ph1b-D, Ph1b-E, and Cohort F. For Cohort F, archival tissue
  is required if a fresh biopsy is not feasible'
- '* A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
  test at screening and within 72 hours of the first dose of study treatment and must
  agree to further serum or urine pregnancy tests during the study. Note: Participant
  must not be pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled
  in this study'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * Cohorts A, B, C, Ph1b-D, D, Ph1b-E, and E: Participant with identified
  mutation in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene
  homolog (NRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), or epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) ectodomain, or ERBB2/HER2 amplification by central
  circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) testing at screening; Cohort F:
  Participant with identified mutation in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF V600, or PTEN, identified
  fusions in ALK, ROS-1, RET, and NTRK 1, ERBB2/HER2 amplification, or identified
  to have MSI-H status by central ctDNA testing at screening'
- Exclude - * Participant with symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis
- Exclude - * History or known presence of leptomeningeal disease
- Exclude - * Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation
  would not be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the
  well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments

summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of amivantamab
  as a monotherapy (Cohorts A, B, and C), to assess the recommended phase 2 combination
  dose (RP2CD) of amivantamab when added to SoC chemotherapy (Ph1b cohorts) and to
  characterize the safety of amivantamab when added to standard-of care (SoC) chemotherapy
  in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (Ph2 cohorts).
