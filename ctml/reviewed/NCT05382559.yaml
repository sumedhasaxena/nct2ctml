summary: 'This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic
  staff will know that they will receive ASP3082. The study aims to check how safe
  and well-tolerated ASP3082 is for people with advanced solid tumors that have a
  specific mutation called KRAS G12D.


  This study will be in 2 parts.


  In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of
  ASP3082 by itself, or together with cetuximab. Any medical problems will be recorded
  at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP3082, by itself or together
  with cetuximab, to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the
  lowest dose of ASP3082. A medical expert panel will check the results from this
  group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP3082. The panel
  will do this for each group until all groups have received ASP3082 (by itself or
  together with cetuximab) or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.


  In Part 2, ASP3082 will be given in by itself, or in combination with the other
  study treatments.


  Study treatments will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each
  treatment cycle is 21 or 28 days long. They will continue treatment until: they
  have medical problems from the treatment they can''t tolerate; their cancer gets
  worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop treatment.'
