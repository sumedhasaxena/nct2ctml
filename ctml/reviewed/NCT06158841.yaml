summary: 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the blood''s plasma cells. The cancer
  is typically found in the bones and bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of the
  bones) and can cause bone pain, fractures, infections, weaker bones, and kidney
  failure. Treatments are available, but MM can come back (relapsed) or may not get
  better (refractory) with treatment. This is a study to determine change in disease
  symptoms of etentamig compared to standard available therapies in adult participants
  with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.


  Etentamig is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R MM.
  This study is broken into 2 Arms; Arm A and Arm B. In Arm A, participants will receive
  etentamig as a monotherapy. In Arm B, participants will receive the standard available
  therapy (SAT) identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with
  the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics,
  and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable. Around 380 adult participants
  with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled at approximately 140
  sites across the world.


  In Arm A participants will receive etentamig as an infusion into the vein in 28
  day cycles, during the 3.5 year study duration. In Arm B, participants will receive
  the SAT identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the
  local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics,
  and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable, during the 3.5 year study duration.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical
  assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires.'
