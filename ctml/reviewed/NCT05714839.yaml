  on or following the last line of treatment.

  for study participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met:'

  involvement with MM.

  keratitis (SPK).

  assessment defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia,
  esophageal/gastric varices, or persistent jaundice.
- Exclude - * Presence of malignancies other than disease under study are excluded,
  except for any other malignancy from which the participant has been disease-free
  for more than 2 years and, in the opinion of the Principal investigator (PI) and
  GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Director, will not affect the evaluation of the effects
  of this clinical trial treatment on the currently targeted malignancy (MM).
- Exclude - * Evidence of cardiovascular risk
- Exclude - * Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy
  to drugs chemically related to belantamab / belantamab mafodotin or any of the components
  of the study treatment. History of severe hypersensitivity to other Monoclonal antibodies
  (mAbs).
- Exclude - * Active infection requiring antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment.
- Exclude - * Known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, unless the participant
  can meet specific criteria.
- Exclude - * Recent history (within the past 6 months) of acute diverticulitis, inflammatory
  bowel disease, intra-abdominal abscess, or gastrointestinal obstruction.
- Exclude - * Participants with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
  will be excluded unless specific criteria can be met
- Exclude - * Presence of active renal condition (infection, requirement for dialysis
  or any other condition that could affect participant's safety). Participants with
  isolated proteinuria resulting from MM are eligible
- 'Exclude - * Part 1: Refractory to belantamab mafodotin (confirmed PD as per IMWG
  criteria while on belantamab mafodotin therapy or within 60 days of completing that
  treatment). Prior belantamab mafodotin is allowed if it was discontinued due to
  toxicity which subsequently resolved.'
- 'Exclude - * Part 2: Prior belantamab mafodotin therapy is not allowed. Prior treatment
  with other anti-BCMA directed agents is allowed provided there is at least a 6-month
  washout period from completion of prior anti-BCMA therapy to start of study therapy.'
- Exclude - * Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study therapy.
- Exclude - * Plasmapheresis within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - * Prior allogeneic transplant is prohibited.
- Exclude - * Participants who have received prior Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell
  therapy (CAR-T) therapy with lymphodepletion with chemotherapy within 3 months of
  screening.
- Exclude - * Any major surgery (other than bone-stabilizing surgery) within 2 weeks
  of first dose or has not recovered fully from surgery.
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with a mAb within 30 days of receiving the first dose
  of study drugs, or treatment with an investigational agent or approved systemic
  anti-myeloma therapy (including systemic steroids) within 14 days or 5 half-lives
  of receiving the first dose of study drugs, whichever is longer.
- 'Exclude - * Part 1: Has received transfusion of blood products (including platelets
  or red blood cells) or administration of colony stimulating factors (including Granulocyte
  colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
  (GMCSF), recombinant erythropoietin) or any thrombopoietin receptor agonists within
  2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.'
- Exclude - * Participants must not receive live/live attenuated vaccines within 30
  days prior to first dose of study treatment or whilst receiving belantamab for at
  least 70 days following last study treatment.
- Exclude - * Known, current drug or alcohol abuse.
- Exclude - * Is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal guardian,
  sibling, or child) who is investigational site or Sponsor staff directly involved
  with this trial, unless prospective Independent Review Board (IRB) approval (by

summary: 'The study consists of two parts: Part 1 The primary purpose of this part
  aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of escalating doses
  of single agent belantamab in participants with refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
  who have received at least 3 prior therapies (4L+). Part 2 The primary purpose of
  this part is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of different
  dose ratios of belantamab mafodotin in combination with belantamab (delivered as
  separate drugs) in participants with RRMM who have received at least 3 prior therapies
  (4L+).'
