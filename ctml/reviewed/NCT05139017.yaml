summary: 'The purpose of this Phase 2/3, randomized, multisite, open-label, dose confirmation,
  and expansion study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of zilovertamab vedotin
  (ZV) in combination with standard of care options for the treatment of rrDLBCL.
  This study will be divided into 2 parts: Dose Confirmation (Part 1) and Efficacy
  Expansion (Part 2) and will enroll participants who are at least 18 years of age
  with rrDLBCL. The hypotheses are: ZV in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine,
  and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is superior to R-GemOx with respect to progression-free
  survival (PFS) per Lugano response criteria by blinded independent review committee
  (BICR); and that ZV in combination with bendamustine rituximab (BR) is superior
  to BR with respect to PFS per Lugano response criteria by BICR.


  With protocol amendment 4 (effective: 04-April-2024), enrollment in Cohort B (study
  arms Bendamustine Rituximab \[BR\] and ZV + BR) is discontinued. No efficacy outcome
  analysis and hypothesis testing will be conducted for Cohort B.'
