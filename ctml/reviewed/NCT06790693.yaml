summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of inavolisib
  plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and letrozole versus
  placebo plus a CDK4/6i and letrozole in the first-line setting in participants with
  endocrine-sensitive PIK3CA-mutated hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), advanced breast cancer (ABC).
