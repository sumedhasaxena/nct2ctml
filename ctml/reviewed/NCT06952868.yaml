summary: This Phase II study, titled "A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and
  Safety of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) Using B10 L-BPA in Patients with
  Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers," aims to assess the efficacy and safety
  of B10 L-BPA-based BNCT in this patient population. The primary objective is to
  evaluate its efficacy, while secondary objectives include assessing safety, survival
  outcomes, tumor response, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of B10 L-BPA and
  boron.
