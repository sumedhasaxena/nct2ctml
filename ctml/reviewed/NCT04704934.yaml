prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Adults (according to local regulation) and able to provide informed consent for
  study participation.'
- '* Pathologically documented gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma that has been previously
  treated in the metastatic setting (unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic
  disease).'
- '* Progression on or after first-line therapy with a trastuzumab or approved trastuzumab
  biosimilar-containing regimen. Note: Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with
  a trastuzumab-containing regimen can be counted as a line of therapy if the subject
  progressed on or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
  Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy that does not include trastuzumab will not
  be counted as a line of therapy regardless of the progression status of the subject.'
- '* Locally or centrally confirmed HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and evidence of
  HER2 amplification by ISH) as classified by ASCO-CAP on a tumor biopsy obtained
  after progression on or after a first-line trastuzumab or approved trastuzumab biosimilar-containing
  regimen.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 at Screening.'
- '* Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic function, and blood clotting function within
  14 days of randomization.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Use of anticancer therapy after trastuzumab-containing treatment
- Exclude - * Medical history of myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before
  randomization/enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association
  Class II to IV).
- Exclude - * Has a QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation
  to \>470 msec (female subjects) or \>450 msec (male subjects) based on average of
  the Screening triplicate12-lead ECG.
- Exclude - * Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD/pneumonitis)
  that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis
  cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.
- "Exclude - * Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid\
  \ arthritis, Sj\xF6gren syndrome, sarcoidosis, etc.) where there is documented (or\
  \ a suspicion of) pulmonary involvement at the time of Screening."
- Exclude - * Prior complete pneumonectomy.
- Exclude - * Spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system
  metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic or requiring therapy with corticosteroids
  or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms.
- Exclude - * Has multiple primary malignancies within 3 years, except adequately
  resected non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, other solid
  tumors curatively treated.
- Exclude - * History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to either the T-DXd or
  inactive ingredients in T-DXd.
- Exclude - * History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies,
  including ramucirumab or to any of its excipients.
- Exclude - * Known allergy or hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or any components used
  in the paclitaxel preparation or other contraindication for taxane therapy.
- "Exclude - * Current uncontrolled infection requiring antibiotics, antivirals, or\
  \ antifungals or an unexplained fever \\>38.0\xB0C during Screening visits or on\
  \ the first scheduled day of dosing (at the discretion of the Investigator, participants\
  \ with tumor fever may be enrolled), which in the Investigator's opinion might compromise\
  \ the participant's participation in the study or affect the study outcome"
- Exclude - * Clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder (eg, including hepatic
  disorders, bleeding, inflammation, occlusion, ileus, diarrhea Grade \>1, jaundice,
  intestinal paralysis, malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel
  disease, or partial bowel obstruction) in the opinion of Investigator
- Exclude - * Has history of receiving live, attenuated vaccine (mRNA and replication
  deficient adenoviral vaccines are not considered attenuated live vaccines) within
  30 days prior to the first exposure to study intervention

summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan
  (T-DXd) compared with ramucirumab and paclitaxel (Ram + PTX) in participants with
  HER2-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have
  progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen and have not received any
  additional systemic therapy.
