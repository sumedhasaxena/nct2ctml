summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of:


  * casdatifan when taken alone in participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies
  and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) during the dose escalation stage; and

  * casdatifan monotherapy and casdatifan in combination with cabozantinib or zimberelimab
  in participants with ccRCC in the dose expansion stage'
