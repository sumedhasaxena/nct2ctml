summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy
  of a new treatment approach for T4-stage esophageal cancer, which involves chemoradiotherapy
  after induction chemotherapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:


  * Does the new induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation reduce esophageal
  perforation rate?

  * Does the new induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation increase treatment
  response rate and patient survival? Researchers will analyze the above data to see
  if the new treatment approach works to treat T4 esophageal cancer.


  Participants will:


  * Receive induction chemotherapy for 4 to 8 cycles, followed by chemoradiation therapy
  if downstage to T3

  * Visit the clinic once every week for checkups and tests

  * Keep a diary of their symptoms'
