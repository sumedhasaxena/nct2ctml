summary: 'c-MET is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. Essential
  components of signal transduction pathways regulating processes including cell proliferation,
  differentiation, migration, metabolism, and cell cycle control, RTKs are established
  targets as treatment strategies for various cancers. c-MET is expressed mainly in
  epithelial tissues and is subject to dysregulation manifesting as mutations, amplifications,
  and overexpression. c-MET is implicated in both primary oncogenesis, metastasis
  and also as a mechanism of drug resistance. c-MET has a high affinity for its naturally
  occurring ligand, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF, also known as Scatter Factor).
  Binding of HGF to c-MET induces several complex signaling pathways, resulting in
  cell proliferation, survival, motility, induction of cells polarity, scattering,
  angiogenesis, and invasion. c-MET alterations are identified in various cancers.


  Several drugs targeting c-MET inhibition have been developed, and capmatinib was
  approved by FDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14
  skipping mutation. ABN401 competitively attaches to the ATP binding sites in the
  kinase domain of c-MET with high specificity to inhibit phosphorylation of downstream
  signaling pathways. Following several animal studies of advanced solid cancers,
  the first-in-human trial of ABN401 showed anti-tumor activity without DLT, and the
  phase 2 trial is ongoing.


  Recently, the basket trials have been emphasized for tissue agnostic approach targeting
  certain genetic alterations, and the NCI-MATCH (National Cancer Institute-MATCH)
  trials in 3,000 patients with advanced solid cancers are ongoing.


  Similarly, the KOSMOS-II study is ongoing in Korea. This study is the basket trial
  that Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic alterations, which is confirmed
  in Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), provide the individual treatment approach.'
