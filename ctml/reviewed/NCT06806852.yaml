prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent HNSCC of the primary
  tumour location of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx not amenable
  to locoregional treatment with curative intent.'
- '* Willingness to provide pretreatment (baseline) biopsy/tissue to the sponsor (fresh
  or archival one). A newly obtained biopsy is preferred but an archival sample is
  acceptable, with tumor tissue (formalin fixed paraffin embedded \[FFPE\] block preferred,
  or at least 10 freshly sectioned unstained FFPE slides) from a core or excisional
  biopsy. Any deviation from this rule requires approval by the sponsor. Details on
  the requirements for archival tumour tissue and on biopsy sample collection are
  provided in the Laboratory Manual.'
- '* Patients who have not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic or recurrent
  HNSCC. Systemic therapy (including cetuximab) which was completed more than 6 months
  prior to progression of disease if given as part of multimodal treatment for locally
  advanced disease is allowed.'
- '* Patients who do not have contraindications to pembrolizumab monotherapy according
  to pembrolizumab local label, guidelines, treatment standards, regulations or the
  document (label of another country if pembrolizumab local label is not available)
  provided in the investigator site file (ISF) by the sponsor.'
- '* Patients who do not have contraindications to treatment with cetuximab according
  to cetuximab local label, guidelines, treatment standards, regulations, or the document
  (label of another country if cetuximab local label is not available) provided in
  the ISF by the sponsor.'
- '* Presence of at least one measurable non-central nervous system (CNS) lesion (according
  to RECIST v1.1.).'
- '* Further inclusion criteria apply.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of any histology, primary tumour location
  at nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses of any histology, any cancer of unknown primary.
- Exclude - * Any tumour location necessitating an urgent therapeutic intervention
  (e.g., palliative care, surgery, or radiation therapy), such as spinal cord compression,
  other compressive mass, uncontrolled painful lesion, bone fracture.
- Exclude - * Patients with progressive HNSCC within 6 months of completion of systemic
  therapy for locoregionally advanced disease with curative intent.
- Exclude - * Receiving treatment for brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease (LMD)
  which may interfere with safety and/or endpoint assessment. Patients with previously
  diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and
  have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to trial
  entry, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases and are clinically
  stable, off anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable before
  enrollment.
- Exclude - * Patients for whom single agent pembrolizumab is not the preferred treatment
  (e.g. patients for whom chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 in combination with chemotherapy
  is considered the preferred therapy by the investigator or treating physician).
- "Exclude - * Prior treatment with any anti signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03B1\
  ) or anti-integrin-associated protein (CD47) agent, regardless of treatment intent."
- Exclude - * Prior cancer treatment with any anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 agent or with
  an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory Tcell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4,
  OX 40, CD137), regardless of treatment intent.
- Exclude - * Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.
- Exclude - * Further exclusion criteria apply.

summary: 'This study is open to adults with head and neck cancer. The purpose of this
  study is to find out whether combining different study medicines makes tumors shrink
  in people with head and neck cancer.


  The tested medicines in this study are antibodies that act in different ways against
  cancer. BI 770371 and pembrolizumab may help the immune system fight cancer. Cetuximab
  blocks growth signals and may prevent the tumor from growing.


  Participants are put into 3 groups randomly. Each group receives a different combination
  of study medicines. All study medicines are given as an infusion into a vein at
  the study site.


  Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment. Doctors
  regularly check the size of the tumor and check whether it has spread to other parts
  of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants'' health and take note
  of any unwanted effects.'
