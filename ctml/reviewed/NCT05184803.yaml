summary: 'Gastric cancer is the fifth most common carcinoma in the world, and cancer-related
  deaths rank third. It is one of the main causes of death from cancer in Korea. The
  cure method for gastric cancer is radical resection, but in most patients, radical
  resection is impossible due to local infiltration or peripheral organ or distant
  metastasis. Many assisted chemotherapy has been studied to improve survival rate,
  and in East Asia, assisted chemotherapy after complete D2 resection is the standard
  treatment. In the West, on the other hand, preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative
  assisted chemotherapy are currently standard treatments. However, due to the limited
  effect of adjuvant chemotherapy, it has been reported that better clinical course
  can be improved by increasing anticancer intensity.


  In this context, a large number of prior chemotherapy have been attempted, and prior
  chemotherapy has several potential effects as follows. (1) Improvement of R0 resection
  rate due to reduced primary cancer size, (2) early treatment for micro metastasis,
  (3) evaluation of treatment response rate in patients with measurable lesions, and
  (4) unnecessary laparotomy can be avoided in patients with biologically aggressive
  diseases.


  Based on the efficacy of chemotherapy in the combination of docetaxel, fluoropyrimidine,
  and platinum in metastatic gastric cancer, the investigators conducted a preceding
  auxiliary anti-cancer clinical trial of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin in
  advanced gastric cancer patients who could not be completely resected by surgery.
  DXP was performed 4-6 cycles before surgery with the recommended dose in phase 1-2.
  In a total of 49 patients, R0 resection was performed in 31 (63%), and among patients,
  R0 resection was improved in cases where resection was not possible due to local
  infiltration (71%) and in cases where para-aortic node metastasis was performed
  (73%).


  We have reported that docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and S-1 chemotherapy (DOS) as preoperative
  adjuvant therapy can be safely administered in combination with D2 gastrectomy and
  postoperative adjuvant therapy S-1 in potentially resectable local progressive gastric
  cancer patients. R0 resection was achieved in 97.6% of patients, and pathological
  complete remission was observed in 19.5%. Based on this, a phase 3 PRODIGY study
  was performed to evaluate the benefit of S-1 (CSC group) as a preoperative prior
  chemotherapy compared to S-1 (SC group) as a postoperative adjuvant therapy in gastric
  cancer of cT2/3N+ or cT4Nany stage, and 0.75% of the CSC group was administered
  HR. In the patient group undergoing surgery, the R0 resection rate was 95% in the
  CSC group and 84% in the SC group. In the CSC group, the pathological complete remission
  rate was 10.4%.


  Based on these results, a clinical trial of DOS as a preoperative chemotherapy was
  planned for progressive gastric cancer that could not be resected due to local progression
  or metastasis limited to remote lymph nodes.


  Primary goal: Evaluation of R0 resection rate in patients who underwent prior chemotherapy
  as a clinical trial.


  Secondary objective: safety evaluation, overall survival period, progression-free
  survival period, pathological complete remission rate, and investigation of biological
  markers.'
