summary: "This is a multi-centre, two-part, open-label, phase 1, first in human study\
  \ of multiple ascending doses of RC220 bisantrene formulation alone and in combination\
  \ with fixed dose doxorubicin to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics\
  \ (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) in adult patients with advanced solid tumours where\
  \ an anthracycline may be considered as a treatment option / or is indicated.\n\n\
  The study will consist of Part 1 - dose-escalation, to determine the maximum tolerated\
  \ combination dose of RC220 with doxorubicin to be evaluated in Part 2 - dose-expansion\
  \ cohort, in patients with solid tumours that are anthracycline treatment na\xEF\
  ve and for whom treatment with doxorubicin is indicated. The objective of Part 2\
  \ will be to confirm the safety and tolerability and evaluate the preliminary cardioprotective\
  \ and anti-tumour efficacy of the maximum tolerated combined dose (MTCD) of RC220\
  \ with doxorubicin."
