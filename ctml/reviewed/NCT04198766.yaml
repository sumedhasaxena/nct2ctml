  or for whom no further standard or clinically acceptable therapy exists.'
- '* Part 2 (single-agent expansion cohort): Subjects with NSCLC, melanoma, HNSCC,
  G/GEA, RCC, or TCC, with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic,

  chemotherapy): Subjects with melanoma (all types), HNSCC, G/GEA, RCC, TCC, NSCLC,
