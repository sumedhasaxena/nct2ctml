prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Multiple myeloma (MM) according to IMWG diagnostic criteria'
- '* Were triple-class exposed (received prior treatment with a PI, an IMiD, and anti
  CD38 mAb)'
- '* Documented evidence of progressive disease based on investigator''s determination
  of response by IMWG criteria on or after their last regimen'
- '* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0
  or 1 at screening. Participants with ECOG-PS 2 or 3 are eligible for the study if
  the ECOG-PS score is related to stable physical limitations (e.g., wheelchair-bound
  due to prior spinal cord injury) and not related to multiple myeloma or associated
  therapy'
- '* Be willing and able to adhere to the lifestyle restrictions specified in the
  protocol'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Contraindications or life-threatening known allergies, hypersensitivity,
  or intolerance to any study drug or its excipients
- Exclude - * Stroke, transient ischemic attack, or seizure within 6 months prior
  to screening
- 'Exclude - * Any of the following within 6 months prior to the first dose of study
  treatment: severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction; major thromboembolytic
  event (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident), clinically significant
  ventricular arrythmia or heart failure New York Heart Association functional classification
  Class III or IV. Uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis is not considered exclusionary'
- Exclude - * Major surgery or had significant traumatic injury within 2 weeks prior
  to the start of administration of talquetamab, or will not have fully recovered
  from surgery, or has major surgery planned during the time the participant is expected
  to be treated in the study or within 2 weeks after administration of the last dose
  of study treatment
- Exclude - * A WETT score suggesting severe dysgeusia at screening. Also unresolved/severe
  dysgeusia referred by the participant or a finding in the physical examination/oral
  cavity inspection. Some examples include leukoplakia, prior mouth cancers, extensive
  dental caries, severe periodontitis, active oral infections, candidiasis, parotic
  gland removal, or radiotherapy with resultant xerostomia

summary: The purpose of this study is to identify preventive treatments that can minimize
  the occurrence, severity, and duration of talquetamab-related taste changes (dysgeusia),
  during the prophylaxis (preventive) treatment phase, and to better characterize
  the signs or symptoms of talquetamab-related taste changes.

        A along with talquetamab therapy. Participants will start the assigned prophylaxis
        7 days before starting talquetamab treatment. After step-up dosing of talquetamab
        therapy, participants will be treated with talquetamab with prophylaxes for
        up to 12 months during prophylaxis treatment phase (if there are clinical
        benefits prophylaxis treatment can continue beyond 12 months, at the treating
        physician's discretion, after consultation with sponsor). The Talquetamab
        treatment phase will continue from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) until disease progression,
        death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation of talquetamab,
        or end of study, whichever occurs first.
