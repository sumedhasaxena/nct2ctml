summary: 'The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant treatment
  with autogene cevumeran plus nivolumab compared with nivolumab in participants with
  high risk MIUC.


  In this study participants will be enrolled in a safety run-in phase to receive
  autogene cevumeran + nivolumab. This phase will be conducted to monitor and ensure
  the safety of study participants. After all participants in the safety run-in have
  been enrolled to receive autogene cevumeran + nivolumab, further participants will
  be randomization in either autogene cevumeran + nivolumab or the saline + nivolumab
  arm.'
