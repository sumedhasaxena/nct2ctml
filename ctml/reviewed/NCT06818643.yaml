  hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks, and have undetectable
  HBV viral load prior to randomization.'
- '* Who has history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if HCV viral
  load is undetectable at screening'
- '* Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 assessed
  within 3 days before intervention allocation/randomization'

summary: Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with certain advanced
  solid tumors. Advanced means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and
  cannot be removed with surgery. Solid tumors are cancers mostly in body organs and
  tissues, not in the blood or other body liquids. The main goal of this study is
  to learn about the safety of MK-3120 and if people tolerate it.
