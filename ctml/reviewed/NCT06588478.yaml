summary: "The main purpose of Part 1 of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety\
  \ of 3 dose levels of Pirtobrutinib in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia\
  \ (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), who have received 1-3 lines of treatment\
  \ including a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The purpose of Part\
  \ 2 of this study is to evaluate pirtobrutinib monotherapy in participants with\
  \ treatment-na\xEFve CLL/SLL with 17p deletions. Participation in Part 1 is expected\
  \ to last approximately 3 years. Participation in Part 2 is expected to last up\
  \ to 2 years."
