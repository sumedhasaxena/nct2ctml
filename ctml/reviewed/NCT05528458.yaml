prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures
- 2. Adult male or female patients, aged from 30 to 75 years
- '3. Pathologic proven lung adenocarcinoma with additional persistent GGNs in at
  least one other lobe: GGN is defined as a ground glass-opacity with well-defined
  margin, mean density above -500 HU and greater than 7.5 mm in its maximum diameter'
- 4. The resected lung adenocarcinoma should have actionable EGFR mutation, which
  is limited to L858R or exon 19 deletion.
- 5. WHO performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and
  a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks
- 6. Complete surgical resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory.
- 7. Uneventful recovery from curative-intent lung cancer surgery
- For assignment in the control arm, subjects should be classified post-operatively
  as Stage IA on the basis of pathologic criteria (the 8th edition of TNM staging
  system for lung cancer).
- For assignment in the treatment arm, subjects should fulfil the following criteria
  in addition to the above criteria.
- '* Patients must be classified post-operatively as Stage IB, II or IIIA on the basis
  of pathologic cirteria (the 8th edition of TNM staging system for lung cancer)'
- '* Female subjects should be using highly effective contraceptive measures, and
  must have a negative pregnancy test and not be breast-feeding prior to start of
  dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing
  potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:'
- '* Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least
  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments'
- '* Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments
  and with LH and FSH levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution'
- '* Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral
  oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation'
- Further information in Appendix E (Definition of Women of Childbearing Potential
  and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods)
- \- Male subjects should be willing to use barrier contraception during the study
  and for 4 months after last dose of osimertinib
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Regression of synchronous GGN after adjuvant chemotherapy prior to
  osimertinib
- Exclude - 2. Past history of postoperative ALI/ARDS or pneumonia during recovery
  period
- Exclude - 3. Currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first
  dose of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be strong inducers
  of CYP3A4 (at least 3 week prior) (Appendix C). All patients must try to avoid concomitant
  use of any medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known
  inducer effects on CYP3A4.
- Exclude - 4. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including
  uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's
  opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which
  would jeopardise compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis
  B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions
  is not required.
- Exclude - 5. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases,
  inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection
  that would preclude adequate absorption of osimertinib.
- 'Exclude - 6. Any of the following cardiac criteria:'
- Exclude - * Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) \> 470 msec obtained from 3
  electrocardiograms (ECGs), using the screening clinic ECG machine derived QTc value.
  Whenever QTc, is mentioned in this document, this refers to correction e made by
  Fridericia formula (QTcF),
- Exclude - * Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology
  of resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block
  and second degree heart block.
- 'Exclude - * Patient with any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation
  or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities (including:
  Serum/plasma potassium \< lower limit of normal (LLN); Serum/plasma magnesium \<
  LLN; Serum/plasma calcium \< LLN) , congenital long QT syndrome, family history
  of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree
  relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval and cause
  Torsades de Pointes'
- Exclude - 7. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial
  lung disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence
  of clinically active interstitial lung disease.
- 'Exclude - 8. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function (as demonstrated
  by any of the following laboratory values:'
- Exclude - * Absolute neutrophil count \<1.5 x 109/L;
- Exclude - * Platelet count \<100 x 109/L;
- Exclude - * Haemoglobin \<90 g/L;
- Exclude - * Alanine aminotransferase \>2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) if
  no demonstrable liver metastases or \>5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases;
- Exclude - * Aspartate aminotransferase \>2.5 times ULN if no demonstrable liver
  metastases or \>5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases;
- Exclude - * Total bilirubin \>1.5 times ULN if no liver metastases or \>3 times
  ULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's Syndrome \[unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia\]
  or liver metastases;
- Exclude - * Serum creatinine \>1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance
  \<50 mL/min \[measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation\]-confirmation
  of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is \>1.5 times ULN.
- Exclude - 9. Women who are breast-feeding
- Exclude - 10. Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using and
  effective method of birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding
  or have a positive (urine or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry.
- Exclude - 11. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to AstraZeneca
  staff or staff at the study site).
- Exclude - 12. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of osimertinib
  or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to osimertinib.
