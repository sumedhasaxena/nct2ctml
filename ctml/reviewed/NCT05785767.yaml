prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Patients with non-squamous or squamous histology NSCLC with stage IIIB or stage
  IIIC disease who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation
  per investigator assessment or stage IV (metastatic disease), who received no prior
  systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC.
- 2. Availability of an archival or on-study formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
  tumor tissue sample, without intervening therapy between biopsy collection and screening
  as described in the protocol
- "3. For enrollment in phase 2, patients should have PD-L1 levels \u2265 50%, as\
  \ determined by a College of American Pathologists (CAP)/Clinical Laboratory Improvement\
  \ Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalently licensed, according to local regulations) accredited\
  \ laboratory, as described in the protocol. For enrollment in phase 3, patients\
  \ should have expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in \u226550%\
  \ of tumor cells stained using an assay performed by a central laboratory, as described\
  \ in the protocol."
- 4. At least 1 radiographically measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT) or
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
  version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria. Target lesions may be located in a previously
  irradiated field if there is documented (radiographic) disease progression in that
  site.
- "5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u22641."
- 6. Adequate organ and bone marrow function, as described in the protocol.
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - 1. Patients who have never smoked, defined as smoking \u2264100 cigarettes\
  \ in a lifetime."
- Exclude - 2. Active or untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients
  are eligible if central nervous system (CNS) metastases are adequately treated,
  and patients have neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs
  or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.
  Patients must be off (immunosuppressive doses of) corticosteroid therapy.
- Exclude - 3. Patients with tumors tested positive for actionable epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations,
  or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) fusions, as described in the protocol.
- Exclude - 4. Encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior
  to enrollment.
- "Exclude - 5. History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\
  \ or organizing pneumonia), of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive\
  \ doses of glucocorticoids to assist with management, or of pneumonitis within the\
  \ last 5 years. A history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field is permitted\
  \ as long as pneumonitis resolved \u22656 months prior to enrollment."
- Exclude - 6. Known primary immunodeficiencies, either cellular (eg, DiGeorge syndrome,
  T-cell-negative severe combined immunodeficiency \[SCID\]) or combined T- and B-cell
  immunodeficiencies (eg, T- and B-cell negative SCID, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, ataxia
  telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency).
- 'Exclude - 7. Ongoing or recent (within 2 years) evidence of significant autoimmune
  disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which
  may suggest risk of immune-mediated treatment-emergent adverse events (imTEAEs).
  Patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus or with uncontrolled adrenal
  insufficiency are excluded. The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood
  asthma that has resolved, residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone replacement,
  or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.'
- Exclude - 8. Patients with a condition requiring corticosteroid therapy (\>10 mg
  prednisone/day or equivalent) within 14 days of randomization. Physiologic replacement
  doses are allowed even if they are \>10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent, as long
  as they are not being administered for immunosuppressive intent. Patients with clinically
  relevant systemic immune suppression within the last 3 months before trial enrollment
  are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted, provided that they are
  not for treatment of an autoimmune disorder.
- 'Exclude - 9. Patients who have received prior systemic therapies are excluded with
  the exception of the following:'
- "Exclude - 1. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (after\
  \ surgery and/or radiation therapy) if recurrent or metastatic disease develops\
  \ more than 6 months after completing therapy as long as toxicities have resolved\
  \ to CTCAE grade \u22641 or baseline with the exception of alopecia and peripheral\
  \ neuropathy."
- Exclude - 2. Anti-PD-(L) 1 with or without LAG-3 as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy
  as long as the last dose is \>12 months prior to enrollment.
- "Exclude - 3. Prior exposure to other immunomodulatory or vaccine therapies as an\
  \ adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4)\
  \ antibodies as long as the last dose is \\>6 months prior to enrollment. Immune-mediated\
  \ AEs must be resolved to CTCAE grade \u22641 or baseline by the time of enrollment.\
  \ Endocrine immune-mediated AEs controlled with hormonal or other non-immunosuppressive\
  \ therapies without resolution prior to enrollment are allowed."
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol-defined Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria apply.'

summary: 'This study is researching an experimental drug called fianlimab (also called
  REGN3767), combined with a medication called cemiplimab (also called REGN2810),
  individually called a "study drug" or collectively called "study drugs". The study
  is focused on patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


  The aim of the study is to see how effective the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab
  is in treating advanced NSCLC, in comparison with cemiplimab by itself.


  The study is looking at several other research questions, including:


  * What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs

  * How much study drug is in your blood at different times

  * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the
  drug less effective or could lead to side effects)

  * How administering the study drugs might improve your quality of life'
