summary: 'This is a Phase II/III study. Patient population is adult participants with
  PSMA-positive mCRPC who had treatments with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor
  (ARPI) and taxane-based chemotherapy and progressed on or after \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA
  targeted therapy.


  Treatment of interest: the investigational treatment is AAA817 regardless of subsequent
  anti-neoplastic treatment. The control treatment is investigator''s choice of Standard
  of Care, regardless of subsequent anti-neoplastic treatment'
