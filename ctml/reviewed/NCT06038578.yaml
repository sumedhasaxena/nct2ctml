prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic, or locally advanced and
  unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.'
- '* The patient is eligible to receive Ramucirumab + Paclitaxel.'
- '* Documented objective radiographic or clinical disease progression (e.g., any
  new or worsening malignant effusion documented by ultrasound examination) which
  may be confirmed by pathologic criteria (histology and/or cytology) if appropriate,
  during or after treatment. The prior treatment must meet one of the following criteria
  with the following treatment history:'
- 1. First treatment for metastatic disease or locally advanced disease without experiencing
  adjuvant / neo-adjuvant treatment, which progressed during treatment or within 4
  months after the last dose of treatment
- 2. Adjuvant / neo-adjuvant treatment which progressed more than 6 months after the
  last dose of treatment and first treatment for metastatic disease or locally advanced
  disease, which progressed during the treatment or within 4 months after the last
  dose of treatment
- 3. Adjuvant / neo-adjuvant treatment which progressed during treatment or within
  6 months after the last dose of treatment
- 4. Adjuvant / neo-adjuvant treatment which progressed during treatment or within
  6 months after the last dose of treatment and first treatment for metastatic disease
  or locally advanced disease, which progressed during treatment or within 4 months
  after the last dose of treatment
- '* Presence of primary or metastatic disease, measurable per RECIST v1.1 on CT scan.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Life expectancy of at least 3 months.'
- "* Age \u2265 18 years in the US and Japan, and \u2265 19 years of age in Korea."
- '* Signed, written IRB-approved informed consent.'
- '* Adequate organ function from specimens collected within 14 days prior to Day
  1.'
- '* For men and women of child-producing potential, the use of effective contraceptive
  methods during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of TRK-950.'
- "* All patients must sign a pre-screening consent to assess tumor tissue to determine\
  \ eligibility. Tumor tissue must be evaluable for CAPRIN-1 staining at a CLIA certified\
  \ laboratory and meet or exceed the cutoff value (30% at \u2265 2+ staining) as\
  \ defined in the expression level requirements."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Prior history of treatment with ramucirumab or paclitaxel.
- Exclude - * HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
- Exclude - * Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval of \> 470 msec for females and
  \> 450 msec for males calculated using Fridericia's formula.
- Exclude - * New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II - IV symptomatic congestive
  heart failure, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia.
- Exclude - * The patient has experienced any arterial thrombotic event, including
  myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic
  attack, within 3 months prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * The patient has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required
  steroids or has current pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Clinically symptomatic venous thromboembolism or current treatment with
  anti-coagulants. (Patients receiving prophylactic and low-dose anticoagulation therapy
  are eligible provided that the coagulation parameter defined in the Inclusion Criterion
  9 is met.)
- "Exclude - * Uncontrolled arterial hypertension \u2265 150 mmHg (systolic) or \u2265\
  \ 90 mmHg (diastolic) despite standard medical management."
- Exclude - * Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring
  systemic therapy.
- Exclude - * Pregnant or nursing women.
- Exclude - * Treatment with radiation therapy within 2 weeks, or treatment with chemotherapy,
  immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or investigational therapy within 4 weeks prior
  to randomization (within 2 weeks for Oral FU (S1 and capecitabine)).
- Exclude - * The patient has significant bleeding disorders, vasculitis, or had a
  significant bleeding episode from the gastrointestinal tract within 3 months prior
  to randomization.
- Exclude - * Clinically significant ascites, paracentesis in the last 3 months, or
  undergoes regular paracentesis procedures.
- Exclude - * History of gastrointestinal perforation and/or fistulae within 6 months
  prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * The patient has a serious or non-healing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone
  fracture within 28 days prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * The patient has a bowel obstruction, history or presence of inflammatory
  enteropathy or extensive intestinal resection (e.g., hemicolectomy or extensive
  small intestine resection with chronic diarrhea), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
  or chronic diarrhea.
- Exclude - * Known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Patients
  with a history of hepatitis B or C are allowed if HBV DNA or Hep C RNA are undetectable.
- "Exclude - * The patient is currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an\
  \ investigational product or non-approved use of a drug, or concurrently enrolled\
  \ in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically\
  \ compatible with this study. Patients who have recently discontinued dosing of\
  \ study drug are eligible to participate as long as the final dose of study drug\
  \ was \u2265 28 days from randomization for participation in this study. Patients\

summary: This study will assess the efficacy, safety, optimal dose and ADA and NAbs
  development of TRK-950 at two separate dose levels in combination with ramucirumab
  and paclitaxel (RAM+PTX) as compared with RAM + PTX treatment alone in participants
  with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
