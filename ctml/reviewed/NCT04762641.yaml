- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of any progressive locally
  advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors that have relapsed or are refractory
  following the last line of treatment, for which prior standard therapy has been
  ineffective, standard therapy does not exist, or is not considered appropriate.'
- '* With AE(s) excluding alopecia or Grade 2 toxicities that are deemed stable or
  irreversible (eg, peripheral neuropathy) from prior therapy that have improved to
  Grade 1 or the baseline grade more than 14 days prior to the first administration
  of the study drug'
- '* Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal functions confirmed based on the screening
  laboratory tests and reconfirmed with additional safety laboratory tests performed
  within 72 hours prior to the first administration of ABL503'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Prior anticancer monoclonal antibody treatment or investigational therapy\
  \ within 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug or has not recovered\
  \ (ie, \u2264 Grade 1 or at baseline grade) from AEs due to previously administered\
  \ agent more than 14 days prior to ABL503 administration"
- "Exclude - * Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks or targeted\
  \ small molecule therapy within 5 half-lives prior to the first administration of\
  \ study drug or has not recovered (ie, \u2264 Grade 1 or at baseline grade) from\
  \ AEs due to previously administered agent more than 14 days prior to ABL503 administration"
- Exclude - * Requiring or received systemic steroid therapy or any other immunosuppressive
  therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration.
- Exclude - * Risk factors for bowel obstruction or bowel perforation (including but
  not limited to a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and abdominal
  carcinomatosis.
- Exclude - * Discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to any intolerable
  immune-related adverse events (IrAEs) requiring systemic steroid treatment
- Exclude - * History of drug-induced pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease) or currently
  has pneumonitis
- Exclude - * Received prior treatment with an anti-4-1BB antibody
short_title: This is a Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of ABL503, and

summary: 'This is a first-in-human Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose,
  dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL503 to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
  MTD and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary antitumor activity, and the PD
  effect of ABL503 in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable)
  or metastatic solid tumors who are relapsed or refractory following the last line
  of treatment and have no available standard of care option. This study includes
  3 parts: a dose-escalation part, a dose-expansion part and tumor-expansion part'

      arm_description: ABL503 will be administered biweekly of every 28-day cycle
        in the dose-escalation. The dosing interval to be used in the dose-expansion
        part will be re-evaluated based on the emerging safety and PK data from the
        dose-escalation part of the study.
