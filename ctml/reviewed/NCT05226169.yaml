summary: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
  IV FCM(ferric carboxymaltose) in patients with AGC receiving palliative chemotherapy.
  This study will also evaluate the effect of IV FCM on the treatment outcomes of
  palliative chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer receiving fluoropyrimidine
  and platinum-based regimen in the same 1st-line palliative setting.
