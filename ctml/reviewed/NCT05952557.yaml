- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Women and Men; \u226518 years at the time of screening (or per national guidelines)"
- '* Histologically confirmed ER+/HER2- early-stage resected invasive breast cancer
  with absence of any evidence of metastatic disease as defined in the protocol.'
- '* Completed adequate (definitive) locoregional therapy (surgery with or without
  radiotherapy) for the primary breast tumour(s), with or without (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.'
- '* Patients must be randomised within 12 months of definitive breast surgery.'
- '* Patients may have received up to 12 weeks of endocrine therapy prior to randomisation.'
- "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u2264 1"
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
- Exclude - * Pathological complete response following treatment with neoadjuvant
  therapy
- Exclude - * History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
  in situ of the cervix or considered a very low risk of recurrence per investigator
  judgement) unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of 5 years
  from the date of randomisation
- Exclude - * Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the
  investigator's opinion precludes participation in the study or compliance "
- "Exclude - * Known LVEF \\<50% with heart failure NYHA Grade \u22652."
- Exclude - * Mean resting QTcF interval \> 480 ms at screening
- Exclude - * Concurrent exogenous reproductive hormone therapy or non topical hormonal
  therapy for non-cancer-related conditions
- Exclude - * Any concurrent anti-cancer treatment not specified in the protocol with
  the exception of bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) or RANKL inhibitors ( eg,
  denosumab)
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with camizestrant, investigational SERDs/investigational
  ER targeting agents, or fulvestrant
- Exclude - * Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive serum pregnancy test) or
  breastfeeding.
- Exclude - * Patients with known hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients
  of camizestrant or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to camizestrant.
  In pre-/peri-menopausal female and male patients, known hypersensitivity or intolerance
  to LHRH agonists that would preclude the patient from receiving any LHRH agonist.

summary: This is a Phase III open-label study to assess if camizestrant improves outcomes
  compared to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with ER+/HER2- early
  breast cancer with intermediate-high or high risk for disease recurrence who completed
  definitive locoregional therapy (with or without chemotherapy). The planned duration
  of treatment in either arm within the study will be 7 years.
