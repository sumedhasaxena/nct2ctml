prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Pre- or postmenopausal women or men.
- 2. Locally advanced and/or metastatic ER+ breast cancer with radiological or clinical
  evidence of progression on an AI in combination with either palbociclib or ribociclib
  as their first hormonal treatment for metastatic disease.
- 3. Histological or cytological confirmation of ER+/HER2 - disease
- 4. No evidence of progression for at least 6 months on an AI/CDKi combination for
  advanced breast cancer.
- 5. At least 1 or more ESR1 point mutations in the ESR1 ligand binding domain as
  assessed in cell- free ctDNA obtained from a blood or breast cancer tissue.
- 6. Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with either measurable (according
  to RECIST 1.1) or non-measurable lesions.
- 7. Subjects may have received 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic
  disease setting prior to study entry, but must have recovered from chemotherapy
  acute toxicity excluding alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.
- 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1
- 9. Adequate organ function
- 10. Able to swallow tablets
- '11. Brain metastases are allowed only if the following 4 parameters hold:'
- 1. Asymptomatic,
- 2. Definitively treated (e.g., radiotherapy, surgery),
- 3. Not requiring steroids up to 4 weeks before study treatment initiation, AND
- 4. Central nervous system disease stable for \>3 months prior to registration as
  documented by magnetic resonance imagining (MRI).
- 12. Able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent before any
  screening procedures.
- 13. Every attempt should be made to obtain a biopsy of metastatic breast cancer
  tissue, when safe and feasible, to provide histological or cytological confirmation
  of ER+/HER2- disease as assessed by a local laboratory, according to American Society
  of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines, using slides,
  paraffin blocks, or paraffin samples. If a biopsy is done, it may undergo genomic
  testing at some point to assess for ESR1 mutations and correlation with ctDNA results.
  If a biopsy is not possible or inappropriate from a clinical standpoint, the ER
  and HER2 status from the subject's most recent biopsy must confirm that the subject
  is ER+ and HER2
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis involving the lung.
- Exclude - 2. History of Grade 3 or Grade 4 interstitial lung disease (ILD) on previous
  therapy.
- Exclude - 3. Visceral crisis in need of cytotoxic chemotherapy as assessed by the
  investigator.
- Exclude - 4. Prior progression of disease on abemaciclib, fulvestrant, or other
  selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) therapy.
- Exclude - 5. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to fulvestrant or to any of
  the excipients
- Exclude - 6. Radiotherapy within 30 days prior to Visit 0 (Day 1) except in case
  of localized radiotherapy for analgesic purposes or for lytic lesions at risk of
  fracture, which can then be completed within 7 days prior to Visit 0 (Day 1). Subjects
  must have recovered from radiotherapy toxicities prior to Visit 0 (Day 1).
- Exclude - 7. Known RB1 mutations or deletions that in the opinion of the investigator
  confer resistance to CDK4/6i. (Screening for RB1 mutation is not required for entry.)
- Exclude - 8. History of long QTc (Q-T interval corrected for heart rate) syndrome
  or a QTc of \>480 msec.
- Exclude - 9. History of a pulmonary embolus (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or
  any known thrombophilia, unless the event occurred greater than 6 months prior to
  screening and the subject is treated with chronic anticoagulant therapy such as
  apixaban (Eliquis) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
- Exclude - 10. Lasofoxifene is not recommended for use in subjects with conditions
  that place them at increased risk for VTEs (such as severe congestive heart failure
  \[CHF\] or prolonged immobilization).
- Exclude - 11. On concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- Exclude - 12. On strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers.
- Exclude - 13. Any significant co-morbidity that would impact the study or the subject's
  safety, including subjects with significant malabsorption.
- Exclude - 14. Active systemic bacterial or fungal infection (requiring intravenous
  \[IV\] antibiotics or antifungals at the time of initiating study treatment).
- Exclude - 15. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis
  B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- Exclude - 16. History of malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding breast cancer),
  except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin curatively treated by surgery.
- Exclude - 17. Positive serum pregnancy test (only if premenopausal).
- Exclude - 18. Sexually active premenopausal women and men unwilling to use double-barrier
  contraception.
- Exclude - 19. Women who are breast feeding
- Exclude - 20. History of non-compliance to medical regimens.
- Exclude - 21. Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
- Exclude - 22. Current participation in any clinical research trial involving an
  investigational drug or device within the last 30 days.

summary: "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability\
  \ of the combination of lasofoxifene and abemaciclib compared to fulvestrant and\
  \ abemaciclib for the treatment of pre- and postmenopausal women and men who have\
  \ previously received ribociclib or palbociclib-based treatment and have locally\
  \ advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth\
  \ factor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer with an estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutation.\n\
  \nThe main question the study aims to answer is:\n\n\u2022 To compare the efficacy\
  \ of the combination of lasofoxifene and abemaciclib with that of fulvestrant and\
  \ abemaciclib Participants will receive either receive 5 mg/d of oral lasofoxifene\
  \ plus oral abemaciclib 150 mg twice a day or the combination of fulvestrant 500\
  \ mg intramuscular (IM) on Days 1, 15, and 29 and then once monthly thereafter plus\
  \ oral abemaciclib 150 mg twice a day."
