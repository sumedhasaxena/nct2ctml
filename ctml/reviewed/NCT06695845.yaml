prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Is at least 18 years of age inclusive at the time of signing the informed consent
- 2. Participants with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors
  (except Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC), defined as gallbladder cancer or cholangiocarcinoma)
  who have progressed following at least 1 prior systemic treatment for metastatic
  or advanced disease and have no available treatment options that have confirmed
  benefit. Prior treatment with HER2-targeted therapy is not permitted (Cohort 1 only).
  For participants with breast cancer (Cohort 2) or GEA (Cohort 3), prior HER2-targeted
  therapy is permitted and prior therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is required.
- 3. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) must be determined by a sponsor designated central
  laboratory.
- 4. All participants must have adequate tumor sample for submission to allow central
  HER2 testing.
- 5. Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion as assessed by Independent Central Review
  (ICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST
  1.1)
- 6. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
- 7. Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator.
- '8. Participants with history of treated and stable CNS metastases are eligible,
  provided the following criteria are met:'
- 1. Participants also have measurable metastatic disease with HER2 overexpression
  (IHC 3+) outside the CNS.
- 2. Participants with treated CNS metastases that are no longer symptomatic may be
  included in the study if they recovered to \< Grade 1 (CTCAE Version 5.0 or higher)
  or baseline from the acute toxic effect associated with the treatment \> 7 days
  prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.
- "3. Prior stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic radiotherapy should be completed\
  \ at least 7 days (\u2265 7 days) before the first dose of study intervention."
- 9. Adequate organ functions.
- 10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result.
- 11. Females of childbearing potential and males with a partner of childbearing potential
  must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Has known or suspected leptomeningeal disease and/or untreated brain
  metastasis.
- Exclude - 2. Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease
- Exclude - 3. Has ongoing toxicity related to prior cancer therapy
- Exclude - 4. Has uncontrolled infection or requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals,
  or antifungals.
- Exclude - 5. Has known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
- Exclude - 6. Has active hepatitis B or C infection.
- Exclude - 7. Has an active SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Exclude - 8. Has a history of life-threatening hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibody
  (mAbs) or to recombinant proteins or excipients in the drug formulation of zanidatamab.
- Exclude - 9. Has any serious underlying medical or psychiatric condition that would
  impair the ability of the participant to receive or tolerate the planned treatment
  at the investigational site.
- Exclude - 10. Has any issue or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
  would contraindicate the participant's participation in the study or confound the
  results of the study.
- Exclude - 11. Prior treatment with HER2-targeted therapy (Cohort 1 only).
- Exclude - 12. Has a history of trauma or major surgery
- Exclude - 13. Was treated with systemic antineoplastic therapy, including hormonal
  therapies for breast cancer, or any investigational therapy within 4 weeks or 5
  half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.
- Exclude - 14. Received zanidatamab at any time prior to the current study.
- Exclude - 15. Colorectal Cancer (CRC) participants with known KRAS/NRAS and BRAF
  mutations.
- Exclude - 16. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) participants with known ALK, EGFR
  mutations and ROS1 fusion.
- Exclude - 17. Female participants who are breastfeeding or pregnant, and female
  and male participants planning a pregnancy.
- Exclude - 18. Prior or concurrent invasive malignancy other than the disease under
  study, whose natural history or treatment has, in the opinion of the investigator
  or medical monitor, the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment
  of the investigational regimen.
