summary: "Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, is proven as an effective therapy for germline\
  \ BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer; however, the therapeutic efficacy for somatic mutation\
  \ in BRCA1/2 or genes of homologous recombination DNA repair is unclear. Maintenance\
  \ of Oalaprib can delay the disease progression in patients with BRCA1/2 mutated\
  \ advanced ovarian cancer after treatment with platinum based chemotherapy. The\
  \ investigators design a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance of\
  \ Olaparib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The investigators enroll patients\
  \ with metastatic ER(+)Her2(-) or triple-negative breast cancer. Patients who are\
  \ chemotherapy-na\xEFve or prior 1-line chemotherapy are eligible for screening.\
  \ All eligible patients will receive 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy. Gene\
  \ test will be performed on their breast tumor. If patients have mutation of HR\
  \ genes and at least stable disease after platinum based chemotherapy, they will\
  \ be randomized to treatment arm (Olaparib maintenance) or control arm (continuation\
  \ of chemotherapy). The primary end-point is progression-free survival, and the\
  \ secondary end-point is to assess the response rate, overall survival and quality\
  \ of life."
