summary: CVM-1118 is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential
  anti-cancer therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. CVM-1118 is a potent anti-cancer agent in
  numerous human cancer cell lines. The safety of administrating CVM-1118 on human
  has been evaluated from the phase 1 study. The objective of the phase 2 study is
  to further investigate the efficacy of CVM-1118 with nivolumab for subjects with
  unresectable advanced hepatoma.

        Nivolumab, 240 mg, IV, Q2 weeks with an option for 480 mg, IV, Q4 weeks starting
        from Cycle 3 if judged to be reasonable by the investigator based on the safety
        and tolerability.


        CVM-1118, 200 mg, PO, BID with an option to increase the starting dose to
        300 mg, PO, BID for the subsequent subjects following assessment of safety
        data from the initial 10 subjects. Escalation of the starting dose will be
        dependent on the absence of Dose Limiting Toxicity in at least 7 of the initial
        10 subjects treated at 200 mg, PO, BID.


        Individual subjects receiving a starting dose of 200 mg, PO, BID and who tolerate
        the initial 2 cycles with no more than Grade 2 related toxicity, will have
        the option of increasing their dose of CVM-1118 to 300 mg, PO, BID (600 mg
        total daily dose) starting with cycle 3


        Tolerable dose of Nivolumab and CVM-1118 will be administered continuously
        for a 28-day cycle until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or consent
        withdrawal.'
