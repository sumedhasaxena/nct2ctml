prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- Part 2 Only
- \- Has a histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
  (NSCLC), non-mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability-high tumors colorectal
  cancers (non-MSI-H CRC), or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and confirmed HLA types HLA-A11:01
  and/or HLA C08:02 (and/or potentially other additional HLA types to be specified).
- 'NSCLC: Participants must have been tested for mutations affecting EGFR and/or anaplastic
  lymphoma kinase (ALK). Participants with ALK or epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR)-positive NSCLC must have had recurrent or progressive disease (PD) after
  treatment with the corresponding inhibitor and current standard of care, in any
  sequence.'
- 'Non-MSI-H CRC: Participant tumors must have been locally tested for MSI and have
  been found to be non-MSI-H.'
- All
- '* Has a histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic KRAS 4MUT+ (G12D, G12V,
  G13D or G12C) (4 prevalent KRAS mutant antigens in solid tumors) solid tumor identified
  by local laboratory testing, and who have received, or been intolerant to, or ineligible
  for all treatment known to confer clinical benefit.'
- '* A male participant must agree to use study-approved contraception during the
  treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study intervention
  and refrain from donating sperm during this period.'
- '* A female participant was not be pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at not be a
  woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR if a WOCBP, agrees to follow study-approved
  contraceptive guidance during treatment period and for at least 120 days after the
  last dose of study intervention.'
- '* Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the local site investigator/radiology.
  Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression
  has been demonstrated in such lesions.'
- '* For Part 1 only: Cutaneous lesions can be considered in addition to imaging,
  but measurable disease should be defined by radiologic assessment.'
- '* Have an evaluable archival tumor sample to submit for analysis. Formalin-fixed,
  paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides.'
- '* Have adequate organ function'
- '* Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
  (ECOG) Performance Scale.'

  in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids,
  or immunosuppressive drugs) except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.
- Exclude - * Has not fully recovered from any effects of major surgery or has evidence
  of detectable infection. Surgeries that required general anesthesia must be completed
  at least 2 weeks before first study treatment administration. Surgery requiring
  regional/epidural anesthesia must be completed at least 72 hours before first study
  treatment administration and participants should be recovered.

  within 4 weeks (2 weeks for palliative radiation) prior to the first dose of study
  therapy, non-cytotoxic small molecule therapeutics within 5 half-lives (or 2 weeks,
  whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study treatment, or has not recovered
  to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or better from any
  adverse events that were due to cancer therapeutics administered more than 4 weeks
  earlier (this includes participants with previous immunomodulatory therapy with
  residual immune-related adverse events).
- Exclude - * Has received a live-virus vaccine within 30 days of planned treatment
  start. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.
- Exclude - * Has received hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (eg, granulocyte-colony
  stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, macrophage
  colony stimulating factor) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Discontinued from therapy with an anti-programmed cell death protein
  1 (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another
  stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (TCR; eg, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
  antigen 4 (CTLA-4), CD137 (4-1BB, Tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily 9 \[TNFSF9\]),
  and OX 40 (TNFRSF4), due to a Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event (irAE).
- Exclude - * Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
  agent or has used an investigational device within 28 days prior to the first dose
  of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic
  steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any
  other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study
  drug.
- Exclude - * Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required
  active treatment within the past 2 years.
- Exclude - * Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
  meningitis.
- "Exclude - * Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or\
  \ any of its excipients."
- Exclude - * Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids
  or has current pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen
  \[HBsAg\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic
  acid (RNA) \[qualitative\] is detected) infection.
- Exclude - * Has a known history of HIV.
- Exclude - * Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere
  with cooperating with the requirements of the study.
- Exclude - * Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children
  within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through
  120 days after the last dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.
