- Exclude - * Acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, in
  the last 4 weeks preceding screening.
- Exclude - * Brain trauma, or cerebral or a spinal cord surgery or spinal procedures
  such as lumbar puncture or epidural/spinal anesthesia within 4 weeks of screening

  agent alone or in combination with aspirin

  in the preceding 4 weeks
- Exclude - * Planned brain, spinal cord, cardiac, vascular, major thoracic and/or
  major abdominal surgery in the 4 weeks following randomization

  Hg or diastolic BP \>100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment)
- Exclude - * Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling or unable
  to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the study from screening up
  to 3 days after last treatment of dalteparin or 100 days after administration of
  abelacimab
- Exclude - * Sexually active males with sexual partners of childbearing potential
  must agree to use a condom or other reliable contraceptive measure up to 3 days
  after last treatment of dalteparin or 100 days after administration of abelacimab
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breast-feeding women
- Exclude - * History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs (including dalteparin)
  or its excipients, to drugs of similar chemical classes, or any contraindication
  listed in the label for dalteparin
- Exclude - * Subjects with any condition that in the judgement of the Investigator
  would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the
  study
- Exclude - * Use of other investigational (not-registered) drugs within 5 half-lives
  prior to enrollment or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to
  baseline, whichever is longer. Participation in academic non-interventional studies
  or interventional studies, comprising testing different strategies or different
  combinations of registered drugs is permitted.
