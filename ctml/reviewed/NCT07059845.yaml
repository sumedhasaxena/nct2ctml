- '* Substudy 1 and 2: Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
  performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Substudy 1: Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of Federation of Gynecology
  and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III or IV high-grade serous ovarian, primary peritoneal,
  or fallopian tube cancer.'
- '* Substudy 1: Tumor must be confirmed HRD test negative (HRP), determined by a
  local homologous recombination deficient (HRD) test.'
- '* Substudy 2: Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous
  ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.'
- '* Substudy 2: Participants must have relapsed after 1 or 2 prior lines of platinum-based
  chemotherapy.'
- '* Substudy 2: Participants must have platinum-sensitive disease defined as radiographic
  progression greater than 6 months from the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy.'
- '* Substudy 2: Participants must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation
  Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (assessed by the investigator) at baseline.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * Substudy 1: Participants with progressive disease (PD) while on triplet
  therapy or after the first day of their last triplet therapy cycle and before randomization.'
- 'Exclude - * Substudy 1: Participants who receive an intervening dose of bevacizumab
  after the first day of their last triplet therapy cycle and before randomization.'
- "Exclude - * Substudy 1: Participants who received prior treatment with mirvetuximab\
  \ soravtansine, any FR\u03B1-targeting agent, or any investigational agent."
- 'Exclude - * Substudy 2: More than 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. Lines of prior
  anticancer therapy are counted with the following considerations:'
- Exclude - * Neoadjuvant +/- adjuvant therapies are considered 1 line of therapy
  if the neoadjuvant and adjuvant correspond to 1 fully predefined regimen; otherwise,
  they are counted as 2 prior regimens.
- Exclude - * Maintenance therapy (e.g., bevacizumab, PARP inhibitor) will be considered
  part of the preceding line of therapy (i.e., not counted independently).
- Exclude - * If a chemotherapeutic agent in a regimen is substituted with another
  during a course of treatment due to toxicity, it will be considered part of the
  proceeding line of therapy
- Exclude - * Prior hormonal therapy will not be counted as a separate line of chemotherapy
  (it will be counted as part of the prior systemic therapy regimen)
- "Exclude - * Substudy 2: Participants who received prior treatment with mirvetuximab\
  \ soravtansine or other FR\u03B1-targeting agents."

summary: 'Ovarian cancer is a lethal disease with an estimated 310,000 new cases and
  200,000 deaths experienced worldwide in 2020. The purpose of this study is to assess
  the adverse events and change in disease activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine with
  carboplatin, or bevacizumab (Bev), or bev alone in participants with ovarian cancer
  (OC). Participants must have confirmation of folate receptor alpha (FRa) positivity
  by the Ventana folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) Assay.


  Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational drug for the treatment of
  OC. Participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 substudies and further into groups called
  treatment arms. In substudy 1, arms A-C, participants will receive 1 of 2 doses
  of MIRV with Bev, or Bev alone. In substudy 2, arms D and E, participants will receive
  1 of 2 doses of MIRV with carboplatin, followed by MIRV alone. Approximately 320
  participants will be enrolled in the study at 100 sites around the world.


  Participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused MIRV with IV infused carboplatin,
  or IV infused Bev, or IV infused Bev alone. The total study duration will be approximately
  40 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests,
  and scans.'
