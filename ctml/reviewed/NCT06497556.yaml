- Exclude - * Known and untreated, or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases
- Exclude - * Leptomeningeal disease or carcinomatous meningitis
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring
  recurrent drainage procedures biweekly or more frequently
- Exclude - * Any infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact
  patient safety, or treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 14 days
  prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with any KRAS G12C inhibitor or pan-KRAS/RAS inhibitor
- Exclude - * More than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung within 6 months of randomization
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled tumor-related pain
- Exclude - * Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy
- Exclude - * History of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception
  of the cancer under investigation in this study and malignancies with a negligible
  risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \>90%), such as adequately treated
  carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate
  cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer

summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of divarasib
  compared to locally approved KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib or adagrasib) in participants
  with KRAS G12C-positive (KRAS G12C +) advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC).
