summary: 'This is an early phase clinical study using NEI-01 as single agent in oncology
  indication. This is an open label study and it''s divided into two parts.


  Part 1: This part is ascending dose design to determine the safety and tolerability
  of NEI-01 and find out recommended dose of NEI-01 in solid tumor patient.


  Part 2: This part is extended dose design to determine the effectiveness of NEI-01
  in in solid tumor and acute myeloid leukemia patients.'
