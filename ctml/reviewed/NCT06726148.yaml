prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "Age \u2265 18 years old."
- 'Patients with one of the following indications:'
- 'Phase I:'
- HR+/HER2- aBC with disease progression on or following at least one line of hormone-based
  therapy in combination with a CDK4/6i and at least one additional line of systemic
  therapy for metastatic disease.
- 'Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or
  metastatic cancer with a CCNE1 amplification. For dose expansion only: no more than
  3 prior lines of therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.'
- 'Phase II:'
- HR+/HER2- aBC with disease progression on an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen in
  combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for unresectable/metastatic disease with no
  more than 2 lines of endocrine therapy.
- Measurable disease as determined by RECIST v1.1.
- 'BC only: If no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic
  bone lesion must be present that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable
  for repeated assessment.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - Previous treatment with a CDK2 inhibitor at any time.
- Exclude - Patients with inadequate bone marrow and/or organ functions with out-of-range
  laboratory values.
- Exclude - Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
  abnormality including MI, CABG, long QT syndrome, or risk factors for TdP.
- Exclude - Presence of symptomatic CNS metastases or CNS metastases that require
  local therapy or increasing doses of corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to study
  entry.
- 'Exclude - For the combination treatment:'
- Exclude - Patients with symptomatic visceral disease or any disease burden that
  makes the patient ineligible for endocrine-based therapy.
- Exclude - Patients who could not tolerate the prescribed dose of ribociclib during
  a previous course of treatment, requiring dose reduction or permanent discontinuation
  due to adverse events.
- 'Exclude - For patients with BC: Patient is concurrently using hormone replacement
  therapy.'
- Exclude - WOCBP who are unwilling to use highly effective contraception methods,
  pregnant or nursing women.
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: 'Phase I: Characterize safety and tolerability of ECI830 as a single agent
  and in combination with ribociclib and fulvestrant. Identify dose range for optimization/recommended
  dose for future studies.


  Phase II: Assess the anti-tumor activity of ECI830 in combination with ribociclib
  and fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer.'
