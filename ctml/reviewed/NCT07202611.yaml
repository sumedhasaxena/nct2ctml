summary: 'Primary Outcomes The primary objective of this trial is to test the safety
  of formulations containing dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells cultured
  in vitro. By evaluating the reactions following the administration of autologous
  dendritic cells via axillary lymph node injection and natural killer cells via intravenous
  injection, the study aims to determine the safety profile of these trial products
  for human use.


  Secondary Outcomes


  To verify the success rate of the cultured cell formulations and assess the cytotoxic
  capacity of natural killer cells in targeting and killing tumor cells. The evaluation
  of these secondary objectives involves analyzing specific subcategories, which can
  be divided into two major components:


  1. Validation of Cultured Cell Preparation Success: Assessing the proliferation
  rate, recovery rate, survival rate, and tumor-killing capacity of the cultured autologous
  dendritic cells and natural killer cells.

  2. Validation of Antitumor Effectiveness: Evaluating the antitumor efficacy of the
  trial products administered via axillary lymph node injection of autologous dendritic
  cells and intravenous infusion of autologous natural killer cells.'
