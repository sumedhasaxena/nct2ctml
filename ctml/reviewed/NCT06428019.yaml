summary: 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia (cancer of
  blood cells). The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of venetoclax in
  combination with obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib in the treatment of CLL. Adverse
  events and change in disease activity will be assessed.


  Venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib is being investigated
  in the treatment of CLL. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 4 groups, called
  treatment arms. Participants will receive oral venetoclax in combination with intravenously
  (IV) infused obinutuzumab or oral acalabrutinib at in different dosing schemes as
  part of treatment. Approximately 170 adult participants with CLL who are being treated
  with venetoclax will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites worldwide.


  Participants in Arm A will receive oral venetoclax in combination with IV infused
  obinutuzumab, with a 5 week venetoclax ramp up. Participants in Arm B will receive
  oral venetoclax in combination with oral acalabrutinib, with a 5 week venetoclax
  ramp up. Participants in Arm C and Arm D will receive oral venetoclax in combination
  with oral acalabrutinib, with differing venetoclax ramp up periods. The total study
  duration is approximately 28 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical
  assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.'
