prior_treatment_requirements:
- Inclusion
- 1. Sign and date the Tissue Prescreening ICF, prior to HER2 and PD-L1 CPS central
  testing. Sign and date the Main Screening ICF, prior to the start of any trial-specific
  qualification procedures. Sign and date the Optional PGx ICF (included in the Main
  Screening ICF) prior to any PGx procedure.
- "2. Adults \u226518 years of age on the day of signing the ICF. Follow local regulatory\
  \ requirements if the legal age of consent for trial participation is \\>18 years\
  \ old."
- 3. Previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gastric or
  GEJ adenocarcinoma histologically confirmed by pathology report. Prior treatment
  in the perioperative and/or adjuvant setting is permissible, provided there is \>6
  months between the end of perioperative or neoadjuvant treatment and the diagnosis
  of recurrent disease.
- 'Note: Prior use of IO (ie, anti-PD-1/PD-L1) therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting
  is allowed as long as there is \>6 months between the end of IO therapy and the
  diagnosis of recurrent disease.'
- 4. Centrally determined HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH-positive) gastric or
  GEJ cancer as classified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of
  American Pathologists for GC on a tumor biopsy as detected by prospective central
  test on new (core, incisional, excisional biopsy) or existing tumor tissue taken
  at the time of diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic disease.
- 'Note: Archival samples taken from a previous diagnostic or surgical biopsy not
  previously irradiated can be accepted. Details pertaining to tumor tissue submission
  can be found in the Study Laboratory Manual.'
- 5. All participants must provide a tumor sample for tissue-based IHC staining to
  centrally determine HER2 expression, PD-L1 CPS, and other correlatives. The mandatory
  FFPE tumor sample can be from either the primary tumor or metastatic biopsy. Specimens
  with limited tumor content (as centrally determined) and cytology samples are inadequate
  for defining tumor HER2 and PD-L1 status.
- 6. At least 1 target measurable lesion on CT or MRI, assessed by the investigator
  based on RECIST v1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered
  measurable if progression has been shown in such lesions.
- "7. LVEF \u226550% within 28 days before randomization."
- exclusion criteria
- 1. Prior exposure to other HER2-targeting therapies (including ADCs).
- 2. Lack of physiological integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract (ie, severe
  Crohn disease that results in malabsorption) or malabsorption syndrome that would
  preclude feasibility of oral chemotherapy (ie, capecitabine).
- '3. Known DPD enzyme deficiency. Note: Screening for DPD enzyme deficiency is required
  only in regions/countries where DPD testing is SoC and with unknown DPD status.
  For regions/countries where DPD testing is not SoC, local practice should be followed.'
- 4. Contraindications to trastuzumab, 5-FU, capecitabine, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin
  treatment as per local label.
- 5. Medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization
  or symptomatic CHF (New York Heart Association Class II to IV). Participants with
  troponin levels above ULN at Screening (as defined by the manufacturer) and without
  any myocardial infarction -related symptoms should have a cardiologic consultation
  during the Screening Period to rule out myocardial infarction.
- 6. Has a corrected QT interval (QTcF) prolongation to \>470 ms (females) or \>450
  ms (males) based on the average of the screening triplicate 12-lead ECG.
- 7. Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has
  current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out
  by imaging at Screening
- 8. Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including, but not
  limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (eg, pulmonary emboli within 3 months
  of the trial randomization, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease, restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, etc).
