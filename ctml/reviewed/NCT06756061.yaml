  consent form
- 2. On the screening visit, those who are diagnosed of a moderate to severe chronic
  graft-versus-host disease according to 2014 NIH consensus criteria
- '-Moderate: At least one of the following conditions: \>1 point for at least three
  organs \>2 points for at least one organ except the lungs \>1 point for the lungs'
- '-Severe: At least one of the following conditions: \>3 points for at least one
  organ'
- '* At least 2 points for the lungs'
- 3. Those who have no history of systemic treatment for chronic graft-versus-host
  disease and now need systemic corticosteroid treatment
- 4. Those whose ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status is 0
  to 2.
- 5. Regardless of the donor (matched sibling-family donor, matched unrelated donor,
  or partially matched family donor), those who have successfully taken same-type
  stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) from the marrow, peripheral blood stem cell,
  or cord blood
- 6. Those who voluntarily agree on participation in this clinical trial
- \[Exclusion Data\]
- 1. Those who meet the following criteria in laboratory tests during the screening
  and randomization visits
- '* Those whose platelet count is less than or equal to 25,000/mm3 without blood
  transfusion'
- '* Those whose absolute neutrophil count is less than or equal to 1,000/mm3'
- '* Those whose total bilirubin \> 3 x ULN for any reason other than chronic graft-versus-host
  disease'
- '2. Those with gastrointestinal troubles that hinder the intake and absorption of
  IMPs and concomitant medicines (systemic corticosteroid) (e.g.: signs such as ulcerative
  disease, unregulated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, etc. or small intestine
  removal)'
- 3. Those with a history of graft-versus-host disease treatment
- '* Corticosteroid administration is permitted for chronic graft-versus-host disease
  treatment within 72 hours before the randomization visit'
- '* Except those who had therapeutic or preventive use of systemic corticosteroids
  and/or systemic immunosuppressants (CNI, MMF) for acute graft-versus-host disease
  (In case of prednisone administration for maintenance, only 0.5 mg/kg/day or less
  is permitted)'
- "4. Those to whom the treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease cannot begin\
  \ as prednisone \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day"
- 5. Those whose same-type stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been confirmed
  as engraft-failed within 6 months before the screening visit
- 6. Those with an experience of ruxolitinib administration for acute graft-versus-host
  disease treatment (however, the patient may participate on the assumption that the
  response to the acute graft-versus-host disease treatment reaches the level of complete
  or partial response and that there is no ruxolitinib administration history within
  4 weeks before the randomization visit. In addition, if ruxolitinib administration
  was for another disease, the patient may participate unless there is no history
  of ruxolitinib administration within 4 weeks before the randomization visit.)
- 7. Those who suffer chronic graft-versus-host disease after an unscheduled donor
  lymphocyte infusion for proactive treatment to prevent the recurrence of a malignant
  tumor (Participation is allowed if the scheduled lymphocyte infusion is performed
  as part of the transplantation procedure, not for the prevention of the recurrence
  of a malignant tumor.)
- '8. Those found to have the following history in the screening visit:'
- '* Relapsed primary malignancy'
- '* Those found to involve an unregulated sinusoidal obstruction syndrome'
- '* Those with a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)'
- '* Nephropathy whose creatinine clearance rate is lower than 30 mL/min (Cockroft
  Gault equation)'
- '* Infections that are clinically active and uncontrolled, requiring treatment,
  including significant bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasitic infections. (However,
  if there are no signs of progression at the time of screening due to appropriate
  treatment, the infection is considered controlled. The progression of infection
  is defined by hemodynamic instability due to sepsis, new symptoms caused by the
  infection, worsening physical signs, or radiological findings. A persistent fever
  without other signs or symptoms is not interpreted as progressive infection.)'
- '* Active tuberculosis'
- '* HIV-infected individual'
- '* Active infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) that the
  investigator views as significant'
- '* Cardiovascular disease that the investigator considers as clinically significant
  (acute cardiac infarction (within 6 months before randomization), NYHA class III
  or IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina (within 6 months before randomization),
  clinically significant symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia (e.g.: continued ventricular
  tachycardia, clinically significant level 2 or 3 AV blockage with no pacemaker used),
  unregulated hypertension)'
- 9. Those allergic or sensitive to additives of IMPs and concomitant medicines (systemic
  corticosteroid) or similar compounds
- 10. Patients with genetic problems such as galactose intolerance, lapp lactase deficiency,
  glucose - galactose malabsorption, etc.
- 11. Those who are administrated with more than 200 mg of Fluconazole per day
- 12. Those being treated with systemic medicines that may hinder blood coagulation
  or platelet functions such as aspirin, heparin, and warfarin (However, those whose
  aspirin administration does not exceed 150 mg/day may participate.)
- 13. Pregnant or breast-feeding women
- 14. Those who do not agree on utilizing proper methods of contraception(e.g. a copper
  intrauterine device (copper loop), an intrauterine device containing hormones, condoms,
  a vasectomy, tubal surgery, a spermicide, a vagina-inserted contraceptive, a subdermal
  implant, an injectable contraceptive, a female condom, oral contraceptive, etc.)
  during the period of this clinical trial(the period of IP administration and at
  least 30 days after IP administration ends)
- 15. Those who have participated in another clinical trial within 30 days before
  the screening visit and have a history of IMP administration/medical equipment application
  (However, if the investigator views such a previous trial as not affecting this
  clinical trial's efficacy and safety assessment such as observational study or retrospective
  study, the subject may participate.)
- 16. Those whose participation in this clinical trial is viewed as inappropriate
  in the investigator's opinion.

summary: 'Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a complication that occurs
  in 30-40% of recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)
  and is a major cause of late non-relapse mortality. In cases where the initial treatment
  response is inadequate, irreversible tissue damage often persists, making it a fatal
  complication that significantly reduces quality of life even for long-term survivors.


  Therefore, the success of first-line treatment is crucial, but to date, there are
  no approved drugs specifically for the first-line treatment of chronic graft-versus-host
  disease. Besides corticosteroids, which have been used palliatively for over 50
  years, there are no proven effective treatments available.


  Against this background, this study was designed to explore the potential of new
  treatments as first-line therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease, where effective
  treatment options are currently lacking.


  Initially, the objective response rate will be analyzed at the 48-week mark based
  on the NIH Consensus Criteria (Lee 2015). Additionally, the study will evaluate
  the proportion of patients with steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent conditions,
  the objective response rate(ORR), failure-free survival(FFS), duration of response(DOR),
  and the proportion of patients who have reduced corticosteroids. Furthermore, the
  differences in treatment effects between the two groups of patients will be analyzed
  based on safety endpoints, including adverse events, laboratory tests, physical
  examinations, and vital signs.'
