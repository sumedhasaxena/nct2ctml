  Archival tumor tissue for histological assessment prior to enrollment is allowed
- "2. Have primary refractory or relapse 12 months or less (\u2264) from initiation\
  \ of frontline therapy Only patients who received 1 prior line of therapy containing\
  \ an anti-Cluster of Differentiation 20 (CD20) antibody and anthracycline are allowed\
  \ for enrollment"
- 3. Have measurable disease with at least one nodal lesion with longer diameter (LDi)
  greater than 1.5 cm or at least one extranodal lesion with LDi greater than 1.0
  cm, documented by diagnostic imaging (computed tomography \[CT\] or magnetic resonance
  imaging \[MRI\])

  by non-primary CNS NHL, as described in the protocol
- Exclude - 2. History of or current relevant CNS pathology, as described in the protocol
- Exclude - 3. A malignancy other than NHL unless the participant is adequately and
  definitively treated and is cancer free for at least 3 years, with the exception
  of localized prostate cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, breast cancer in situ,
  or nonmelanoma skin cancer that was definitively treated
- Exclude - 4. Any other significant active disease or medical condition that could
  interfere with the conduct of the study or put the participant at significant risk,
  as described in the protocol
- Exclude - 5. Wash-out period from prior anti-lymphoma treatments and infections,
  as described in the protocol

summary: 'This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred
  to as study drug. The study is focused on patients with previously treated aggressive
  B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma whose cancer has stopped responding to treatment (also
  known as ''refractory'') or has returned (also known as ''relapsed''). The aim of
  the study is to see how safe, tolerable and effective the study drug is when given
  alone.


  The study is looking at several other research questions, including:


  * What side effects may happen from taking the study drug versus Standard of Care
  (SOC)

  * How much study drug is in the blood at different times

  * Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the
  study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)

  * Comparing the impact from the study drug versus SOC on quality-of-life and ability
  to complete routine daily activities'
