summary: This is a first-in-human study evaluating the anti-T cell immunoglobulin
  and mucin containing protein-3 (TIM-3) antibody TSR-022. The study will be conducted
  in 2 parts with Part 1 consisting of dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion.
  Part 1 will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TSR-022 and Part 2
  will evaluate the antitumor activity of TSR-022 in combination with TSR-042 or docetaxel
  and as monotherapy.
