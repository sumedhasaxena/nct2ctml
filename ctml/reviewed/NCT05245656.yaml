summary: This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled randomized
  trial to determine efficacy and safety of rituximab/bendamustine (RB) alternating
  with rituximab/bendamustine/cytarabine (RBAC) compared with standard RB alone in
  the first-line treatment of elderly patients with mantle cell lymphoma, who are
  not eligible for high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
