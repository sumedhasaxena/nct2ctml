summary: 'Germ cell tumor has generally good prognosis, but high risk germ cell tumor
  has still very poor prognosis. There remains the need of further improvement with
  other chemotherapy strategy. Especially more than 11 years old, mediastinal germ
  cell tumor, stage 3 or 4 extragonodal germ cell tumor or the remained tumor after
  the primary treatment are the group with the poorest prognosis.


  Paclitaxel is widely used chemotherapeutic agent in adults and the experience of
  the agent has also been accumulated in children. The paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin
  (TIP) regimen has been used 2nd-line treatment for germ cell tumor and there is
  some promising result of the role of TIP in first line germ cell tumor treatment.
  In high risk pediatric germ cell tumor patients, TIP regimen will be able to reduce
  lung toxicity from the bleomycin as the standard regimen and to improve the survival.
  In this trial, the efficacy and safety of TIP as the first line treatment for germ
  cell tumor will be elucidated.'
