summary: This is a phase Ib/II open label study. The escalation part will characterize
  the safety and tolerability of JDQ443 single agent and JDQ443 in combination with
  the other study treatments (TNO155 and tislelizumab) in advanced solid tumor patients.
  After the determination of the maximum tolerated dose / recommended dose for a particular
  treatment arm, dose expansion will assess the anti-tumor activity and further assess
  the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD of each regimen at the maximum tolerated dose
  / recommended dose or lower dose.
