prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC with
  evidence of KRAS G12C mutation via tumor sample and/or circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic
  acid (ctDNA).'
- '* Locally advanced or metastatic disease.'
- '* Measurable disease via computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) per RECIST v1.1 criteria of at least 1 lesion.'
- '* No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy given for advanced or metastatic disease.'
- '* Not a candidate for definitive therapy (eg, chemoradiation or complete surgical
  resection).'
- "* Participants with brain metastases are eligible for enrollment, including those\
  \ with untreated brain metastases. Brain metastases must be asymptomatic and not\
  \ in need of immediate local therapy. Any untreated brain metastases must be \u2264\
  \ 20 mm in diameter."
- '* Any PD-L1 expression (0 to 100%) as determined by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay,
  Agilent PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, or Agilent PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Participants with an active autoimmune or inflammatory disease requiring
  systemic treatment within 2 years.
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular conditions within 6 months
  prior to enrollment that are ongoing or with risk of recurrence.
- Exclude - * Inadequate bone marrow or liver function or electrocardiogram (ECG)
  abnormalities.
- Exclude - * Ongoing treatment with concomitant medication known to cause prolonged
  QTc interval and that cannot be switched to alternative treatment prior to study
  entry.
- Exclude - * Treatment targeting KRAS G12C mutation (eg, sotorasib, adagrasib) in
  any setting.
- Exclude - * Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
  drug administration.
- Exclude - * Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
