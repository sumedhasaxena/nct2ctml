summary: 'This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study
  in participants with breast cancer. The study is designed with the flexibility to
  open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment
  arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify
  the patient population.


  Cohort 1 will focus on participants with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic,
  estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2-negative breast cancer who had disease progression
  during or following treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i;
  e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) in the first- or second-line setting.


  Cohort 2 will focus on inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, ER+, HER2-positive
  breast cancer with previous progression to standard-of-care anti-HER2 therapies,
  of which one was a trastuzumab-and-taxane-based systemic therapy (including in the
  early setting if recurrence occurred within 6 months of finishing adjuvant therapy)
  and one was a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; e.g., ado-trastuzumab
  emtansine or trastuzumab-deruxtecan) or a HER2-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  (TKI; e.g., tucatinib, lapatinib, pyrotinib or neratinib).


  Cohort 3 will focus on inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, ER+, HER2-negative,
  PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer with resistance to adjuvant endocrine therapy.'
