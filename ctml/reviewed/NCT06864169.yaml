summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat certain types of advanced
  gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The study medicine raludotatug deruxtecan (also called
  MK-5909, R-DXd, or DS-6000a) is a type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate
  (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy
  those cells.


  The main goal of this study is to learn if the cancer responds to treatment (gets
  smaller or goes away).'
