summary: The goal of this study is to compare how well sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib
  works versus zanubrutinib plus placebo in treating adults with relapsed/refractory
  (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This study will also look at the safety of sonrotoclax
  plus zanubrutinib versus zanubrutinib plus placebo.
