summary: This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of opevesostat compared to
  alternative abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in participants with metastatic
  castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with respect to overall survival (OS)
  and to radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working
  Group (PCWG) Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)
  as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in participants with mCRPC
  previously treated with next-generation hormonal agent (NHA) and taxane-based chemotherapy.
  It is hypothesized that opevesostat is superior with respect to OS and rPFS per
  PCWG Modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR in androgen receptor ligand binding
  domain (AR LBD) mutation-negative and -positive participants.
