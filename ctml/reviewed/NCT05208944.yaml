summary: "THIO is a first-in-class small molecule telomere targeting agent, in development\
  \ for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with cemiplimab\
  \ (LIBTAYO\xAE). THIO is preferentially incorporated into telomeres sequence in\
  \ telomerase-positive cells leading to rapid telomere uncapping, genomic instability,\
  \ and cell death.\n\nCemiplimab is a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor\
  \ recently approved as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced\
  \ or metastatic NSCLC with 50% or more PD-L1 expression. It is hypothesized that\
  \ THIO administration prior to cemiplimab would restore tumor responses to immunotherapy\
  \ in subjects who either developed resistance or relapsed after receiving first\
  \ line treatment with an immune check point inhibitor."
