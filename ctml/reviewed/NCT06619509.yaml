prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion criteria:'
- 1. Patient is ongoing on brigimadlin treatment in any trial sponsored by Boehringer
  Ingelheim (hereafter referred to as the 'parent trial').
- 2. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent form (ICF) in accordance
  with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals
  for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local legislation prior to
  any trial-specific procedures, sampling, or analyses.
- 3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must be
  ready and able to use 2 medically acceptable methods of birth control per ICH M3
  (R2) that result in a low failure rate of \<1% per year when used consistently and
  correctly beginning at Screening, during trial participation, and until 6 months
  and 12 days after the last dose for women and 102 days after the last dose for men.
  A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria and instructions on the duration
  of use is provided in the participant information.
- 4. Participants must be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment
  plan, lifestyle, laboratory tests, contraceptive guidelines, and other study procedures.
- 5. Adequate organ function.
- 6. Patient is eligible to receive continued treatment according to the clinical
  trial protocol of the parent trial they are currently participating in. Patients
  currently experiencing a dose delay in the parent trial due to adverse events are
  eligible if recovery from the adverse event takes place within the allowed time
  window in the parent trial.
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- 1. Any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator should exclude
  the patient from receiving treatment with brigimadlin.
- 2. Participants who must receive or intend to receive restricted medications or
  any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.
- 3. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the
  trial. Female patients who do not agree to the interruption of breastfeeding from
  the start of study treatment until 6 months and 12 days after the last dose of study
  treatment.
- 4. Patient has unacceptable toxicity on brigimadlin at the time of transition into
  this trial.
- 5. Patient has an adverse event (AE) which has caused a dose delay and has not recovered
  within the allowed time window in the parent trial.
- 6. Patient who has already required 2 dose reductions and would require a third
  dose reduction at trial entry, unless the investigator deems treatment continuation
  beneficial, and the third dose reduction is agreed in writing between the investigator
  and the sponsor.
- Further exclusion criteria apply.

summary: 'This study is open to adults with solid tumours who received at least 4
  cycles of treatment with brigimadlin in a previous study. The goal of this study
  is to find out how well people with solid tumours tolerate long-term treatment with
  brigimadlin. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that was being developed
  to treat cancer.


  All participants take brigimadlin as tablets once every 3 weeks at the study site.
  At study visits, doctors check participants'' health and take note of any unwanted
  effects. At some study visits, doctors also check the size of the tumour and whether
  it has spread to other parts of the body. Participants are in the study as long
  as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it.'
