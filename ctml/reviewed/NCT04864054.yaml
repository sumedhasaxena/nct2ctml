- '* GPC3-positive expression in HCC tumor cells confirmed by immunohistochemistry
  (IHC).'
- "* For Phase 1 (dose escalation): \u226510-20% tumor cells, \u22652+ IHC)."

  agents.'
- '* Life expectancy of at least 4 months per the Investigator''s opinion.'
- '* Karnofsky Performance Scale of 70 or higher.'
- '* Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Previously treated lesions are allowed as

- '* Child-Pugh score of A6 or better.'
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Pre-existing illness (e.g., symptomatic congestive heart failure) that
  would limit compliance with study requirements.
- Exclude - * Active, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.
  Subjects with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C are
  eligible provided their infection is being treated and the viral load is controlled.
- "Exclude - * Active malignancy (other than HCC), with the exception of cholangiocarcinoma\
  \ (CCA) or any malignancy without any organ involvement and with an expected survival\
  \ \u2265 3 years without any treatment (exception: hormone/androgen- deprivation\
  \ therapy)."
- Exclude - * Currently receiving or ending (\< 14 days from date of consent) liver
  tumor-directed therapy (e.g., radiation, ablation, embolization), or hepatic surgery.
- Exclude - * Concurrently receiving other investigational agents, biological, chemical,
  or radiation therapies, while participating in the study.
- Exclude - * Active autoimmune disease requiring therapy.
- Exclude - * Compromised circulation in the main portal vein, hepatic vein, or vena
  cava due to obstruction.
- Exclude - * History of organ transplant.
- Exclude - * Advanced HCC involving greater than half (50%) of the liver.

summary: "This is an open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I/II clinical\
  \ trial aimed at assessing the safety and preliminary efficacy of an investigational\
  \ ARTEMIS\xAE ECT204 T-cell therapy. The trial is suitable for adult subjects (\u2265\
  \ 18 years of age) diagnosed with GPC3-positive HCC, who have failed or not tolerated\
  \ at least two (2) different anti-HCC systemic agents.\n\nThe study includes a dose\
  \ escalation phase (Part 1 or Phase I) to determine the Recommended Phase II Dose\
  \ (RP2D), followed by an expansion phase (Part 2 or Phase II) to further assess\
  \ safety and efficacy."
