summary: This is a randomized, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety
  of adjuvant sacituzumab tirumotecan (MK-2870) in combination with pembrolizumab
  compared to treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in participants with triple-negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) who received neoadjuvant therapy and did not achieve a pathological
  complete response (pCR) at surgery. The primary objective is to compare sacituzumab
  tirumotecan plus pembrolizumab to TPC (pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus capecitabine)
  with respect to invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) per investigator assessment.
  It is hypothesized that sacituzumab tirumotecan plus pembrolizumab is superior to
  TPC with respect to iDFS per investigator assessment.
