summary: 'Researchers want to learn if patritumab deruxtecan (MK-1022) can treat certain
  gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The GI cancers being studied are advanced (the cancer
  has spread to other parts of the body). The goals of this study are to learn:


  * About the safety and how well people tolerate of patritumab deruxtecan

  * How many people have the cancer respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment'
