prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed ES-SCLC (using the AJCC \[American
  Joint Committee on Cancer\] tumor node metastasis staging system combined with Veterans
  Administration Lung Study Group \[VALG\]''s two stage classification scheme). For
  AJCC tumor node metastasis staging system: AJCC 8th edition stage IV (T any, N any,
  M1a/b/c), or T3\~4 for multiple lung nodules or tumor/nodule volume that cannot
  be encompassed in a tolerable radiotherapy plan.'
- '* Have not had prior systemic therapy for ES-SCLC. However, participants with prior
  chemoradiotherapy for limited-stage-SCLC must have been treated with curative intent
  and had a treatment-free interval of at least 6 months after the last chemotherapy,
  radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy before diagnosis of ES-SCLC to be eligible.'
- '* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST v1.1.
  Lesions treated after prior local treatment (radiotherapy, ablation, interventional
  procedures, etc.) are generally not considered as target lesions. If the lesion
  with prior local treatment is the only targeted lesion, evidence-based radiology
  must be provided to demonstrate disease progression (the single bone metastasis
  or the single central nervous system metastasis should not be considered as a measurable
  lesion).'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate hematologic and organ function as defined in the protocol.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have histologically or cytologically confirmed SCLC with combined histologies.
- 'Exclude - * Have received any of the following therapies or drugs within the noted
  time intervals prior to study treatment:'
- 'Exclude - * Within 2 weeks: small molecule agents with half-life of \<7 days; radiation
  outside the thoracic cavity including whole brain radiation. Of note, other local
  radiation for brain lesions (not whole brain) is allowed; local radiation for bone
  lesions is allowed. Palliative bone radiation or brain stereotactic radiosurgery
  would not require a washout period, but participants should recover from radiotherapy-related
  toxicity.'
- "Exclude - * Within 4 weeks: radiation involving the thoracic cavity; small molecule\
  \ targeted agents with half-life of \u22657 days; monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug\
  \ conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates, or T-cell or other cell-based therapies."
- Exclude - * Have received prior treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, or programmed death (ligand)-1 (PD\[L\]-1)/VEGF
  bispecific antibody.
- "Exclude - * Have received systemic corticosteroids (at a dosage greater than 10\
  \ mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroids) within 7\
  \ days prior to the initiation of study treatment. Note: local, intranasal, intraocular,\
  \ intra-articular or inhaled corticosteroids, short-term use (\u22647 days) of corticosteroids\
  \ for prophylaxis (e.g., prevention of contrast agent allergy) or treatment of non-autoimmune\
  \ conditions (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by exposure to allergens)\
  \ are allowed."
- 'Exclude - * Have the following central nervous system metastases:'
- Exclude - * Participants with untreated brain metastases that are symptomatic or
  large (e.g., greater than 2 cm).
- Exclude - * Participants with treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases who
  are not neurologically stable or on steroids (at a dosage greater than 10 mg/Day
  of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroid) within 7 days before
  initiating study treatment of this study.
- Exclude - * Participants with known leptomeningeal metastases.
- Exclude - * Have uncontrolled hypertension or poorly controlled diabetes prior to
  study treatment.
- Exclude - * Have a serious or non-healing wound, or (incompletely healed) bone fracture.
  This includes history of abdominal fistula, tracheoesophageal fistula, gastrointestinal
  perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess for which an interval of 6 months must pass
  before study entry. In addition, the participant must have undergone correction
  (or spontaneous healing) of the perforation/fistula and/or the underlying process
  causing the fistula/perforation.
- Exclude - * Have a significant risk of hemorrhage (per investigator clinical judgment)
  as defined in the protocol.
- Exclude - * Have superior vena cava syndrome or symptoms of spinal cord compression
  that requires urgent medical intervention.
- 'Exclude - NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.'

summary: This is a Phase III, multisite, randomized, double-blinded study to investigate
  pumitamig (BNT327) combined with chemotherapy (etoposide/carboplatin) compared to
  atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy (etoposide/carboplatin) for the treatment
  of participants with previously untreated extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer
  (ES-SCLC).
