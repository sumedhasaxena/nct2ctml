summary: This is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase I, multi-center, open-label, study of
  AZD9592, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of several study
  modules, each evaluating the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics
  (PK), pharmacodynamics, anti-tumor activity, and immunogenicity of AZD9592, as monotherapy
  or in combination with anti-cancer agents.
