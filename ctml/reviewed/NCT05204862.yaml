summary: This study consists of Part A for monotherapy and Part B for combination
  therapy to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy
  of TU2218 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of Phase 1 is
  to determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TU2218 and the main purpose
  of Phase 2 is to evaluate the antitumor activity of TU2218 at RP2D.
