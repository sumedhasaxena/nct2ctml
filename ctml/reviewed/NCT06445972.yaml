summary: This is a phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label umbrella platform study that
  will evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab tirumotecan (MK-2870) plus
  paclitaxel versus ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, for the treatment of participants
  with advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
  adenocarcinoma, or esophageal adenocarcinoma who have failed 1 prior line of therapy.
  This is an estimation study, and no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.
