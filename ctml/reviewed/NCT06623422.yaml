summary: The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive intismeran autogene
  and pembrolizumab after surgery are cancer-free longer than people who receive placebo
  and pembrolizumab. Researchers want to know if giving intismeran autogene and pembrolizumab
  after surgery can help prevent the cancer from coming back in people with non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors did not respond completely to treatment before
  surgery (neoadjuvant treatment).
