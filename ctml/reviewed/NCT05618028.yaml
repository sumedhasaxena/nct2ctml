prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Dose Escalation (Part 1) Only: Participants with a documented diagnosis of one
  of the following third line or later of treatment (3L)+ mature B-cell malignancies,
  from the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined histologies as defined in the protocol.'
- '* Dose Optimization (Part 2) Only: Participants with documented diagnosis of chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with histology based
  on WHO criteria, with measurable disease requiring treatment as defined by the International
  Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL).'
- '* Dose Expansion (Part 3) Only: Participants with documented diagnosis of one of
  the 3L+ mature B-cell malignancies based on WHO criteria listed in the protocol,
  with measurable disease requiring treatment.'
- '* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
  (PS) of 0, 1, or 2.'
- '* Participant has a life expectancy \>= 12 weeks.'
- '* Adequate hematological and hepatic function as defined in the protocol.'
- '* Must have archival or freshly collected tumor tissue for correlative studies
  before study enrollment.'
- '* Participants with prior central nervous system (CNS) disease that has been effectively
  treated may be eligible.'
- '* Participants with resolved coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are
  eligible.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Known active CNS disease, or primary CNS lymphoma.
- Exclude - * Known bleeding disorders.
- Exclude - * Known history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 12 months
  prior to first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled active systemic infection, or active cytomegalovirus infection.
- Exclude - * Active and/or chronic hepatitis B or C infection and/or the criteria
  listed in the protocol.
- Exclude - * Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
- Exclude - * Known active COVID-19 infection. Participant must not have signs/symptoms
  associated with COVID-19 infection or known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19
  infection during screening. If participant has signs/symptoms suggestive of COVID-19
  infection, the participant must have a negative molecular (e.g., polymerase chain
  reaction) test or 3 negative antigen test results at least 24 hours apart.

summary: 'B-cell malignancies are a group of cancers of B lymphocytes, a type of white
  blood cell responsible for fighting infections. The purpose of this study is to
  assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-525
  as a monotherapy.


  ABBV-525 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of B-Cell
  Malignancies. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms.
  Participants will receive ABBV-525 at different doses. Approximately 150 adult participants
  will be enrolled in the study across sites worldwide.


  In part 1 (dose escalation), participants will receive escalating oral doses of
  ABBV-525. In part 2 (dose optimization), participants will receive one of two oral
  doses of ABBV-525, until the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. In part
  3 (dose expansion), participants will receive the RP2D oral dose of ABBV-525. The
  estimated duration of the study is up to 64 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests,
  and scans.'
