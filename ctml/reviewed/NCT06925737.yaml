summary: Researchers are looking for new ways to treat metastatic castration-resistant
  prostate cancer (mCRPC). Researchers have designed a study medicine called ifinatamab
  deruxtecan (also called I-DXd or MK-2400) to treat mCRPC. The goal of this study
  is to learn if people who receive I-DXd live longer overall and live longer without
  the cancer growing or spreading than people who receive chemotherapy,
