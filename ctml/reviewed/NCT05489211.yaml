  investigational medicinal device administered in the last 4 weeks prior to first
  dose of study intervention or concurrent enrolment in another clinical study
- Exclude - * Severe hypersensitivity to Dato-DXd or any of the excipients, including
  but not limited to polysorbate 80 or other monoclonal antibodies
- Exclude - * Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study
- Exclude - * Judgment by the investigator that the participant should not participate
  in the study if the participant is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions,
  and requirements
