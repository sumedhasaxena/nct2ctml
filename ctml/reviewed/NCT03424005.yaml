summary: "This is an umbrella study evaluating the efficacy and safety of multiple\
  \ treatment combinations in participants with metastatic or inoperable locally advanced\
  \ breast cancer.\n\nThe study will be performed in two stages. During Stage 1, four\
  \ cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study:\n\nCohort 1 will consist of\
  \ Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive participants who have received no prior\
  \ systemic therapy for metastatic or inoperable locally advanced triple-negative\
  \ breast cancer (TNBC) (first-line \\[1L\\] PD-L1+ cohort).\n\nCohort 2 will consist\
  \ of participants who had disease progression during or following 1L treatment with\
  \ chemotherapy for metastatic or inoperable locally-advanced TNBC and have not received\
  \ cancer immunotherapy (CIT) (second-line \\[2L\\] CIT-naive cohort).\n\nCohort\
  \ 3 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HR+, HER2-negative\
  \ disease with PIK3CA mutation who may or may not have had disease progression during\
  \ or following previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease (HR+cohort).\n\
  \nCohort 4 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+\
  \ /HER2-low disease with PIK3CA mutation who had disease progression on standard-of-care\
  \ therapies (HER2+ /HER2-low cohort).\n\nIn each cohort, eligible participants will\
  \ initially be assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). In addition,\
  \ participants in the 2L CIT-na\xEFve cohort who experience disease progression,\
  \ loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible\
  \ to continue treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2), provided\
  \ Stage 2 is open for enrollment."
