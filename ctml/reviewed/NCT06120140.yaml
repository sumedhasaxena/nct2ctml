prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Is treatment naive and not amenable to curative
  therapy including surgical resection or (chemo) radiation. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant
  therapy for Stage I, Stage II or Stage IIIA disease is allowed if last dose administered
  more than 12 months prior to the development of locally advanced or metastatic disease'
- '* Have a tumor that harbors an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 19del
  or Exon 21 L858R substitution, as detected by an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
  or other validated test in a clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA)-certified
  laboratory (sites in the United States) or an accredited local laboratory (sites
  outside of the United States) in accordance with site standard-of-care'
- '* A participant with asymptomatic or previously treated and stable brain metastases
  may participate in this study. Participants with a history of symptomatic brain
  metastases must have had all lesions treated as clinically indicated (that is, no
  current indication for further definitive local therapy). Any definitive local therapy
  to brain metastases must have been completed at least 14 days prior to randomization,
  and the participant can be receiving no greater than 10 milligram (mg) prednisone
  or equivalent daily for the treatment of intracranial disease'
- '* Can have prior or concurrent second malignancy (other than the disease under
  study) which natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any study
  endpoints, safety, or the efficacy of the study treatment(s). For the amivantamab
  SC expansion cohort: Due to the increased risk of skin cancer with ruxolitinib,
  participants with any prior or concurrent skin malignancies will be excluded'
- '* Sub-study: Participants must have new-onset or persistent (defined as non-responsive
  to standard of care \[SoC\]) Grade \>=2 specific DAEIs of the scalp, face, or body,
  as defined by NCI-CTCAE Grading v5.0 for DAEIs (excluding paronychia)'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * History of uncontrolled illness, including but not limited to uncontrolled
  diabetes; ongoing or active infection (includes infection requiring treatment with
  antimicrobial therapy \[participants will be required to complete antibiotics 1
  week prior to starting background anticancer treatment\] or diagnosed or suspected
  viral infection). For the amivantamab SC expansion cohort, this includes active
  localized serious infections; active bleeding diathesis; impaired oxygenation requiring
  continuous oxygen supplementation; refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal
  diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant bowel
  resection that would preclude adequate absorption of background anticancer treatment
  or doxycycline/minocycline; psychiatric illness, social situation, or any other
  circumstances that would limit compliance with study requirements; any ophthalmologic
  condition that is clinically unstable; pre-existing skin condition that would prevent
  adequate evaluations of dermatologic toxicity, as determined by the investigator
- Exclude - * Medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including drug-induced
  ILD or radiation pneumonitis
- Exclude - * Known allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to the excipients of
  amivantamab, lazertinib, or to tetracyclines, doxycycline, minocycline, timolol\*,
  ruxolitinib\*, zinc\*, corticosteroids\* or their excipients or to any component
  of the enhanced dermatologic management (\*for the amivantamab SC expansion cohort)
- Exclude - * Participant has received any prior systemic treatment at any time for
  locally advanced stage III B/C or metastatic stage IV disease (adjuvant or neoadjuvant
  therapy for stage I, II or IIIA disease is allowed if last dose administered more
  than 12 months prior to the development of locally advanced or metastatic disease)
- Exclude - * Participant has an active or past medical history of leptomeningeal
  disease
- 'Exclude - * Sub-study: Participants who have received prior treatment for epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced DAEIs with JAK inhibitors (for Cohort A) or

summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether enhanced dermatologic management
  can reduce incidence of grade greater than or equal to (\>=) 2 dermatologic adverse
  events of interest (DAEIs) when compared with standard-of-care skin management and
  with modified enhanced dermatologic management in participants with locally advanced
  or metastatic stage IIIB/C-IV epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated first-line with amivantamab and lazertinib. The
  study also includes an Expansion cohort to evaluate enhanced dermatologic management
  and early intervention for DAEIs or paronychia, in participants receiving subcutaneous
  amivantamab and lazertinib. A substudy will enroll participants from Arms A and
  B who experience specific new-onset or persistent DAEIs (Grade \>=2) during treatment
  with intravenous (IV) amivantamab and lazertinib. This substudy aims to assess the
  reactive use of dermatologic treatment strategies in these participants.
