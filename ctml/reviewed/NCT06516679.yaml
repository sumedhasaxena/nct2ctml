summary: 'This clinical trial is an open-label, multicenter, prospective phase 2 clinical
  trial targeting pediatric leukemia patients of infant age. The goal is to improve
  survival rates by varying the presence or absence of chemotherapy and hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation based on genetic characteristics at the time of diagnosis
  and minimal residual disease (MRD) values measured by various methods after treatment.


  In addition, by clearly defining the patient group that requires hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation, it is expected that the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in infantile leukemia, for which there have been various guidelines for hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation, can be confirmed. Additionally, due to the characteristics
  of infants, this study aim to identify long-term sequelae or prognosis related to
  treatment by prospectively collecting side effect data related to treatment during
  and after treatment.'
