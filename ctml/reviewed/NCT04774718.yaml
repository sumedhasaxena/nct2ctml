prior_treatment_requirements:
- Inclusion Criteria
- '* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of CNS or solid tumors with documented evidence
  of ALK gene fusions as assessed centrally through the use of the investigational
  F1CDx assay or based on pre-existing NGS test results'
- '* Disease status: prior treatment proven to be ineffective (i.e. relapsed or refractory),
  or for whom there is no satisfactory standard treatment available. Disease should
  be measurable and evaluable as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
  Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, or Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology criteria (RANO)
  +/- bone marrow criteria for primary CNS tumors or International Neuroblastoma Response
  Criteria (INRC)'
- '* Available tumor tissue for submission to the Sponsor from active disease, obtained
  subsequent to last anti-cancer therapy regimen administered and obtained prior to
  study enrollment (preferred option), or archival tumor tissue from original diagnosis,
  or willingness to undergo a core or excisional biopsy sample collection prior to
  enrollment'
- '* For participants \< 16 years old, Lansky Performance Status \>/= 50%'
- '* For participants \>/= 16 years old, Karnofsky Performance Status \>/= 50%'
- '* Adequate bone marrow function as defined by the protocol within at least 28 days
  prior to initiation of study drug'
- '* Participant and/or caregiver willingness and ability to complete clinical outcome
  assessments throughout the study using either electronic, paper, or interviewer
  methods'
- '* For females of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain
  from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from
  donating eggs, as defined by the protocol'
- '* For males who are not surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain
  from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from
  donating sperm, as defined by the protocol'
- Exclude - Exclusion Criteria
- 'Exclude - * Medical history of: prior use of ALK inhibitors; diagnosis of Anaplastic
  Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL); any gastrointestinal disorder that may affect absorption
  of oral medications, such as mal-absorption syndrome or status post-major bowel
  resection; history of organ transplant; stem cell infusions as defined by the protocol'
- Exclude - * Substance abuse within 12 months prior to screening
- Exclude - * Familial or personal history of congenital bone disorders, bone metabolism
  alterations, or osteopenia
- Exclude - * Treatment with investigational therapy 28 days prior to initiation of
  study drug
- Exclude - * Liver or kidney disease as defined by the protocol
- Exclude - * National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
  Events (CTCAE) v5.0 grade \>/=3 toxicities attributed to any prior therapy such
  as radiotherapy (excluding alopecia), which have not shown improvement and are strictly
  considered to interfere with alectinib
- Exclude - * Co-administration of anti-cancer therapies other than those administered
  in this study
- Exclude - * Active hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HBC), or known HIV-positivity or
  AIDS-related illness
- Exclude - * Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could
  interfere with, or for which the treatment might interfere with, the conduct of
  the study or the absorption of oral medications or that would, in the opinion of
  the Principal Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the participant in this
  study
- Exclude - * Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition
  potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol requirements and/or follow-up
  procedures; such conditions should be discussed with the participant before trial
  entry
- Exclude - * Planned procedure or surgery during the study except as permitted treatment
  as defined by the protocol
- Exclude - * Infection considered by the investigator to be clinically uncontrolled
  or of unacceptable risk to the participant upon induction of neutropenia, including
  participants who are, or should be, on antimicrobial agents for the treatment as
  active infection
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the
  study or within 3 months after the final dose of alectinib
