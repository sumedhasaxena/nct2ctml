summary: 'Probiotics are a group of viable microorganisms including bacteria and yeasts
  that if consumed in sufficient amounts, may afford health benefits to the host.
  The major advantage of probiotic administration is its ability to maintain gut microbial
  homeostasis, reduce pathogenic microorganisms in the GI tract, and restores homeostasis
  of intestinal microorganisms. Moreover, by modulating microbiota and immune responses,
  decreasing bacterial translocation, promoting the function of the gut barrier, inducing
  anti- inflammatory properties, triggering anti-pathogenic activity, and decreasing
  tumor development and metastasis, probiotics might contribute to the prevention
  and treatment of GI cancers and lung cancer. Considering the potential roles of
  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the initiation of colorectal and gastric cancers,
  the possible properties of probiotics against GI neoplasm in humans have been investigated
  in relation to their suppressive effects on H. pylori. The gut microbiota also has
  proved to in the response and resistance to immunotherapy. By triggering immune
  activity, probiotics, as functional dietary supplements, may mitigate neoplastic
  predisposition and development of GI cancers. Clostridium butyricum is a spore-forming
  bacillus named for its capacity to produce high amounts of butyric acid and is found
  in soil. Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain (MIYA-BM) is widely used as probiotic
  therapy to improve symptoms related to dysbiosis such as constipation, nonantimicrobial
  diarrhea, and anti- microbial-associated diarrhea in Japan and China. Clostridium
  butyricum increases beneficial bacteria, especially lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.
  Bifidobacterium promotes antitumor immunity and facilitates efficacy of antitumor
  treatment. The antitumor treatments are differed to three types: immune checkpoint
  blockade, target therapy and chemotherapy. Thus, investigators hypothesized that
  probiotic Clostridium butyricum therapy (CBT) may enhance the therapeutic efficacy
  of anti-tumor therapy through the modulation of gut microbiota. Investigators will
  discuss the different kinds of anti-tumor effect in survival and response after
  probiotic supplement.'
