prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Aged \u2265 20 years."
- 2. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer
  whose stage is IIIB, IIIC, IVA, or IVB according to the AJCC Cancer Staging System,
  8th Edition.
- 3. The tumor harbors an exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation in EGFR, confirmed
  locally.
- 4. Patient must have a documented Globo H H-score of at least 100 using a validated
  central IHC assay.
- "5. Patient must have received 3\xB11 months of first-line erlotinib therapy under\
  \ a stable dosage of 150 mg/day, have achieved SD or PR before randomization (as\
  \ confirmed by the Investigator), and plan to continue the erlotinib treatment at\
  \ 150 mg/day."
- 6. At least one measurable tumor lesion according to RECIST version 1.1 as assessed
  by the Investigator (local radiological image assessment).
- "7. Life expectancy \u2265 6 months."
- 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
- '9. Organ Function Requirements - Subjects must have adequate organ functions as
  defined below:'
- "* AST/ALT \u2264 3X ULN (upper limit of normal); AST/ALT \u2264 5X ULN in the presence\
  \ of liver metastases"
- "* Total bilirubin \u2264 2.0 X ULN"
- "* Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5X ULN"
- "* ANC \u2265 1,500 /\xB5L"
- "* Platelets \u2265 100,000/\xB5L"
- 10. All eligible patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraception
  during study treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of OBI-833/OBI-821
  and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of erlotinib. Subjects not of childbearing
  potential (i.e., permanently sterilized, postmenopausal) can be included in the
  study. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative
  medical cause.
- 11. Understand and provide a written informed consent document according to institutional
  guidelines.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Patient who has CNS metastasis.
- Exclude - 2. Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding at entry.
- Exclude - 3. Patient with splenectomy.
- Exclude - 4. Patient with HIV infection, active hepatitis B infection, or active
  hepatitis C infection.
- Exclude - 5. Patient with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 detected by standard
  reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at screening.
- Exclude - 6. Patient with any autoimmune or other disorders requiring IV/oral steroids
  or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.
- Exclude - (e.g., type 1 juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, antibody positive for
  rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, lupus, scleroderma,
  systemic vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, immune mediated thrombocytopenia, Crohn disease,
  ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis).
- Exclude - 7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having
  not resolved to Grade 0 or 1 (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
  Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] version 5.0), except for alopecia and
  laboratory values listed in the inclusion criteria.
- Exclude - 8. A history of other malignancies (except non-melanoma skin carcinoma,
  carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, follicular or papillary thyroid cancer)
  within 5 years prior to randomization.
- Exclude - 9. Patient with any known uncontrolled comorbid illness including ongoing
  or active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA\>2), unstable angina
  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
  limit compliance with study requirements.
- 'Exclude - 10. Treatment with any of the following therapies within 4 weeks prior
  to randomization:'
- Exclude - * Anti-cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy (except
  erlotinib).
- Exclude - * Radiotherapy.
- Exclude - * Immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, interferons,
  and checkpoint inhibitors.
- Exclude - * Immunosuppressants, including cyclosporin, rapamycin, tacrolimus, rituximab,
  alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and cyclophosphamide.
- Exclude - * Other biologics, including G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors.
- Exclude - * Live attenuated vaccines.
- Exclude - * IV/oral steroids except single prophylactic use in CT/MRI scan or other
  one-time use in approved indications. Use of inhaled and topical (except on the
  injection site) steroids is allowed.
- Exclude - * Alternative and complementary medicine that may affect the immune system.
- Exclude - * Other investigational drugs.
- Exclude - 11. Subject with pleural effusions and/or ascites, due to malignancy,
  requiring paracentesis every 2 weeks or more frequently.
- Exclude - 12. Subject with any known severe allergies (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any
  active or inactive ingredients in the study drugs.
- Exclude - 13. Any other reason that the investigator deems the patient to be unsuitable
  for the study.

summary: "This study is a randomized, active control, open-label, phase 2 trial. Erlotinib-treated\
  \ NSCLC patients will be screened for Globo H, and only Globo H+ (H score \u2265\
  \ 100) subjects are eligible for the study. Eligible subjects who have been treated\
  \ with 3\xB11 months of first-line erlotinib and have achieved stable disease (SD)\
  \ or partial response (PR) status will be randomized in the ratio of 1:1 to receive\
  \ erlotinib alone or erlotinib plus OBI-833/OBI-821 therapy."
