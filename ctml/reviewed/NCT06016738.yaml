- '* Adult female or male participants.'
- '* ER+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not amenable
  to curative therapy.'
- '* Evaluable disease (measurable disease or bone-only disease).'
- '* Previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with an endocrine therapy
  in the advanced setting. One additional line of ET as a monotherapy is allowed.
  Duration of the most recent prior ET must be at least 6 months.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal functions.'

  a GnRH (or LHRH) agonist.'
- 'Key exclusion criteria:'
- '* Symptomatic visceral disease, imminent organ failure, or any other reason that
  makes the participant ineligible for endocrine monotherapy.'
- '* Previously received chemotherapy in the advanced/metastatic setting.'
- '* Previously received treatment with elacestrant or an investigational estrogen
  receptor-directed therapy.'
- '* History of allergic reactions to study treatment.'
- '* Any contraindications to the selected standard-of-care endocrine therapy in the
  local prescribing information.'
- '* Symptomatic central nervous system metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, leptomeningeal
  disease, or a spinal cord compression that require immediate treatment.'
- '* Clinically significant comorbidities such as significant cardiac or cerebrovascular
  disease, gastrointestinal disorders that could affect absorption of study treatment.'

summary: This phase 3 clinical trial compares the safety and efficacy of palazestrant
  (OP-1250) to the standard-of-care options of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor
  in women and men with breast cancer whose disease has advanced on one endocrine
  therapy in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
