summary: The purpose of this study is to determine safety and preliminary efficacy
  of amivantamab monotherapy, amivantamab in addition to pembrolizumab, amivantamab
  in addition to paclitaxel and amivantamab in addition to pembrolizumab and carboplatin
  in participants with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer. The study will also
  confirm the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2CD) for amivantamab in addition
  to paclitaxel. The safety and preliminary efficacy of amivantamab in addition to
  pembrolizumab will also be determined in perioperative (before and after surgery)
  setting in participants with resectable locally advanced head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
