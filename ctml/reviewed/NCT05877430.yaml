summary: Study CJB-101-01 will be conducted at multiple centers in the USA and Republic
  of Korea as an open-label safety and preliminary efficacy study of CJRB-101 in combination
  with pembrolizumab in subjects with selected types of advanced or metastatic cancer.
  The proposed study intends to address the unmet medical needs of low response rate
  and refractoriness to immune checkpoint inhibitors typically observed in this subject
  population by performing assessments of response, dose limiting toxicities, pharmacodynamic,
  and the effect on microbiome biomarkers at different dose levels of CJRB-101 combined
  with pembrolizumab.
