prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Has untreated pathologically confirmed colon adenocarcinoma'
- '* Has resectable colon adenocarcinoma defined as clinically T4N0 or Stage III'
- '* Has radiologically evaluable disease'
- '* Has a tumor demonstrating the presence of either dMMR status or MSI-H'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has distant metastatic disease.
- Exclude - * Has received prior medical therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic,
  or targeted therapy), radiation therapy or surgery for management of the current
  diagnosis of colon cancer
- Exclude - * Has a tumor that, in the investigator's judgment is causing symptomatic
  bowel obstruction or otherwise requires urgent/emergent surgery at the time of screening.
  Participants with a history of colonic obstruction are eligible after obstruction
  is relieved by a diverting stoma (defunctioning ileostomy or colostomy). Patients
  with a history of colonic obstruction in the context of current colon cancer diagnosis
  and treated with colonic stents are not eligible.
- Exclude - * Has undergone any major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or experienced
  significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization
- Exclude - * Has any history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis and/or history
  of radiation induced enteritis.
- Exclude - * Has cirrhosis or current unstable liver or biliary disease per investigator
  assessment defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia,
  esophageal/gastric varices, or persistent jaundice
- Exclude - * Has a history of allogenic stem cell transplantation or organ transplantation
- Exclude - * Is receiving any other anticancer or experimental therapy. No other
  experimental therapies (including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal
  treatment, antibody therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, or other
  experimental drugs) of any kind are permitted while the participant is receiving
  study intervention
- Exclude - * Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within
  the projected duration of the study
- Exclude - * Has a history of severe allergic and/or anaphylactic reactions to chimeric,
  human or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or known allergies to dostarlimab,
  or its excipients, or any components of FOLFOX or CAPEOX

summary: The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative
  dostarlimab compared with standard of care (SOC) in participants with untreated
  T4N0 or Stage III (resectable), defective mismatch repair/ microsatellite instability
  high (dMMR/MSI-H) colon cancer.
