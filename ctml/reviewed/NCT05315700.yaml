- '3. Part II Dose Optimization (ONGOING): NSCLC patients with'
- "* Cohort IIA: EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, patients must have received platinum-based\
  \ chemotherapy or other chemotherapy regimen if platinum- based chemotherapy was\
  \ contraindicated. Additionally, patients must be na\xEFve to an EGFR exon 20 targeted\
  \ agent, ie, must have declined or be ineligible for all available exon 20 targeted\
  \ therapies with proven benefit"
- "* Cohort IIB: HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation, patients must have received platinum-based\
  \ chemotherapy or other chemotherapy regimen if platinum- based chemotherapy was\
  \ contraindicated. Additionally, patients must be na\xEFve to a HER2 exon 20 targeted\

- Exclude - * Known EGFR T790M mutation
- Exclude - * Leptomeningeal disease and spinal cord compression
- Exclude - \-- Except if LMD has been reported radiographically on baseline MRI,

  neurological symptoms of LMD
- Exclude - * History of class III or IV congestive heart failure or severe non-ischemic
  cardiomyopathy, unstable or poorly controlled angina, myocardial infarction, or

  virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients positive for HBsAg but normal HBV
  DNA level are allowed.
- Exclude - * Active gastrointestinal disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
  or short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes
- Exclude - * Any other concurrent serious uncontrolled medical, psychological, or

summary: The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
  and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics
  (PD), and antitumor activity of ORIC-114 as a Single Agent or in Combination with
  Chemotherapy when administered to patients with advanced solid tumors harboring
  an EGFR or HER2 alteration.
