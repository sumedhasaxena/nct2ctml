summary: "Although the results obtained from ECOG E5194 cohort 1 (criteria: mammographically\
  \ detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring less than 2.5 cm with margins\
  \ \u2265 3 mm) and RTOG 9804 trial (the same enrolled clinicopathological features\
  \ to cohort 1 of ECOG E5194 trial) demonstrated that the 7-year ipsilateral breast\
  \ tumor recurrence (IBTR) ranged from 5.6% to 10.5% for low-risk ductal carcinoma\
  \ in situ (DCIS) patients, the aforementioned two studies included a proportional\
  \ patients who had young age and negative estrogen receptor (ER) status tumor. Previous\
  \ studies and our studies revealed that age \\< 40 years and ER-negative status\
  \ in tumor were independent prognostic factor for recurrence of breast DCIS irrespective\
  \ of tumor characteristics. The UK/ANZ randomized trial, enrolling high-risk and\
  \ low-risk clinicopathologic features of DCIS, demonstrated that a benefit of tamoxifen\
  \ in terms of reducing the IBTR is observed in the BCS alone group but not found\
  \ in the BCS plus RT group. A recent published randomized trial showed that tamoxifen\
  \ at the dose of 5 mg/day for 3 years.\n\nBased on the aforementioned results, we\
  \ hypothesized that the administration of tamoxifen is not inferior than the prescription\
  \ of RT in terms of reducing the IBTR for DCIS patients who had age more than 40\
  \ years, the pathological features meeting the ECOG E5194 cohort 1 criteria, and\
  \ positive ER status in tumors. To approve the hypothesis, we will design a randomized\
  \ non-inferiority trial to assess whether the effect of administration of tamoxfien\
  \ (5 mg per day) for 10 years following BCS is not inferior in terms of reducing\
  \ IBTR when comparing RT following BCS for patients who had low-risk clinicopathologic\
  \ features (age more than 40 years and ECOG E5194 cohort 1 criteria) and positive-ER\
  \ status of breast DCIS."
