summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat triple-negative breast cancer
  (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR) low positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
  (HER2) negative breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to learn:


  * About the safety of the study treatments and if people tolerate them

  * If people who receive patritumab deruxtecan, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy before
  surgery have fewer cancer cells removed during surgery compared to those who receive
  only pembrolizumab (pembro) and chemotherapy.'
