prior_treatment_requirements:
- Key Inclusion Criteria
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented locally recurrent inoperable, which
  cannot be treated with curative intent, or metastatic TNBC, as defined by the ASCO-CAP
  guidelines.'
- '* ECOG PS 0 or 1.'
- "* Participants are expected to provide an FFPE tumour sample collected from a locally\
  \ recurrent inoperable or metastatic tumour. If no such sample is available, an\
  \ archival FFPE tumour sample can be submitted; it must have been collected \u2264\
  \ 3 years prior to the participant signing informed consent (screening start)."
- "* PD-L1 positive TNBC based on results from an appropriately validated investigational\
  \ PD-L1 (22C3) assay (CPS \u2265 10) from a sponsor designated central laboratory."
- '* No prior chemotherapy or other systemic anti-cancer therapy for metastatic or
  locally recurrent inoperable breast cancer.'
- "\\- Patients with recurrent disease will be eligible if they have completed treatment\
  \ for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and \u22656 months have elapsed between\
  \ completion of treatment with curative intent and the first documented recurrence."
- '* Eligible for one of the chemotherapy options listed as ICC (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel,
  or gemcitabine + carboplatin).'
- '* Measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1.'
- '* Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function.'
- '* Male and female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use protocol-specified
  method(s) of contraception.'
- Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria
- Exclude - * As judged by investigator, any evidence of diseases (such as severe
  or uncontrolled medical conditions including systemic diseases, uncontrolled hypertension,
  serious gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhoea, chronic diverticulitis
  or previous complicated diverticulitis, history of allogeneic organ transplant,
  and active bleeding diseases, ongoing and active infection, significant cardiac
  conditions, substance abuse, psychiatric illness/social situation or psychological
  conditions) which, in the investigator's opinion, makes it undesirable for the participant
  to participate in the study or that would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
- Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated
  with curative intent with no known active disease within 3 years before Cycle 1
  Day 1 and of low potential risk for recurrence.
- Exclude - * Participants with a history of previously treated neoplastic spinal
  cord compression or treated, clinically inactive brain metastases that are no longer
  symptomatic, who require no treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants, may
  be included in the study if they have recovered from acute toxic effects of radiotherapy.
- Exclude - \- Participants with treated clinically inactive brain metastases that
  are no longer symptomatic, who require no treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants,
  may be included in the study if they have recovered from acute toxic effects of
  radiotherapy.
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals.
- Exclude - * Active or uncontrolled hepatitis B or C virus infection.
- Exclude - * Known HIV infection that is not well controlled.
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease.
- Exclude - * History of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis)
  that required steroids, current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that
  cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.
- Exclude - * Severe pulmonary function compromise.
- Exclude - * Clinically significant corneal disease.
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.
- Exclude - * Prior exposure to any treatment including ADC containing a chemotherapeutic
  agent targeting topoisomerase I and TROP2-targeted therapy.
- Exclude - * Any concurrent anti-cancer treatment.
- Exclude - * Participants with a known severe hypersensitivity to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
  or Dato-DXd.
- Exclude - * Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test), breastfeeding
  or planning to become pregnant.
