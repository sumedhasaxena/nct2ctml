summary: 'This is a First-in-Human, Phase 1, Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion study
  of HM16390, as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab to assess safety,
  tolerability, MTD, RP2D, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic
  solid tumors.


  Dose-Escalation Part is planned to establish the MTD or RDs for the randomized Dose-Ranging
  Part. Based on the results of the Dose-Escalation Part, additional eligible subjects
  will be randomized 1:1 into each dose level. After a comprehensive review of available
  data from both Dose-Escalation Part and Dose-Ranging Part, the RDEs to be tested
  in the Dose-Expansion Part are determined. Dose-Expansion Part is designed to assess
  the potential efficacy of HM16390 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab
  when administered at the RDEs to subjects in indication-specific expansion cohorts.'
