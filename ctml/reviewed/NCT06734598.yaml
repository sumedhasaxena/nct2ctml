summary: 'Trismus is a common side effect in head and neck cancer patients after radiation
  therapy. This project aims to explore the therapeutic effect of Botulinum toxin
  (Botox) injection to the masticatory muscles in the above-mentioned patients.


  In this project, Botulinum toxin will be injected into the masticatory muscles (medial
  pterygoid and masticatory muscles), combined with oral rehabilitation exercises,
  to reduce the patient''s masticatory muscle tension and spasm. Patient''s mouth
  opening range, quality of life, trismus condition and pain will be evaluated to
  understand its efficacy.'
