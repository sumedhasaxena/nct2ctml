  or may render the participant at high risk from treatment complications
- Exclude - * Requirement for treatment with any medicinal product that contraindicates
  the use of any of the study treatments, may interfere with the planned treatment,

summary: This open-label, exploratory study is designed to evaluate the safety and
  efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or combinations,
  in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose tumors are biomarker
  positive as per treatment arm-specific definition. Eligible participants with mCRC
  will be enrolled into specific treatment arms based on their biomarker assay results.
