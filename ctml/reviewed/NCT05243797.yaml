summary: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study in participants
  with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to evaluate the benefits of teclistamab in
  combination with lenalidomide and teclistamab alone versus lenalidomide alone as
  maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant.
