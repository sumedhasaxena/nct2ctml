summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
  Viscum album extract when used in combination with pembrolizumab as adjuvant chemotherapy
  in adult patients (aged 19 and older) who have been diagnosed with malignant neoplasm
  of unilateral breast and have completed surgery.


  The main questions it aims to answer are:


  Does the addition of Viscum album improve clinical outcomes when combined with pembrolizumab
  as adjuvant chemotherapy? Is Viscum album safe and tolerable for use in this patient
  population?'
