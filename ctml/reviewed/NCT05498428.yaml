- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced
  or metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is not amenable to curative
  therapy including surgical resection or chemoradiation. Additional Cohort specific
  disease requirements include: Cohorts 1, 3, 3b, 5, 6 and 7: epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion (Exon19del) or Exon 21 L858R mutation; Cohort 2:
  EGFR Exon 20ins mutation. Cohorts 1,5,and6: Participant should not have received
  any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Cohort 2: Participant
  should not have received any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic
  NSCLC. Cohorts 3and3b: Participant must have progressed on or after osimertinib
  monotherapy as the most recent line of treatment. Osimertinib must have been administered
  as either the first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease or
  in the second-line setting after prior treatment with first- or second-generation
  EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as a monotherapy. Cohort 4: Participants need
  to currently be on an amivantamab IV Q2W regimen (1,050 mg or 1,400 mg depending
  on weight) for at least 8 weeks, as part of standard of care, an expanded access
  program, or as a rollover from a long-term extension, without any amivantamab dose
  reduction. Cohort 7: Participants must have progressed on or after the combination
  of amivantamab and lazertinib as the most recent line of treatment. The combination
  of amivantamab and lazertinib must have been administered as the first-line treatment
  for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Cohort 2, 3, 3b, and 7 only: Squamous
  NSCLC are excluded. EGFR mutation must have been identified as determined by Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or other validated test of either circulating
  tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) or tumor tissue in a clinical laboratory improvement
  amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory (sites in the United states \[US\]) or an
  accredited local laboratory (sites outside of the US). A copy of the initial test
  report documenting the EGFR mutation must be included in the participant records
  and a deidentified copy must also be submitted to the sponsor'
- '* All cohorts except Cohort 4: Participants must have at least 1 measurable lesion,
  according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.
  If the only target lesion has been previously irradiated, it must show signs of
  disease progression since radiation was completed If only 1 non-irradiated measurable
  lesion exists, which undergoes a biopsy and is acceptable as a target lesion, the
  baseline tumor assessment scans should be performed at least 14 days after the biopsy'
- '* May have a prior or concurrent second malignancy (other than the disease under
  study) which natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any study
  endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the study treatment(s)'
- '* Have adequate organ (renal, hepatic, hematological, coagulation and cardiac)
  functions'
- '* Participant must have eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) status of 0 or
  1'
- '* Cohort 6: Must be eligible for, and agree to comply with, the use of prophylactic
  anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant or a low molecular weight heparin
  during the first 4 months of study treatment'
- '* A participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or freeze for future
  use for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period
  of 6 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. Participants with
  child bearing potential should consider preservation of eggs prior to study treatment
  as anti-cancer treatments may impair fertility'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
