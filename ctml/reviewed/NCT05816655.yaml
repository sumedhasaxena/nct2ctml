summary: 'Aromatase inhibitor (AI) + CDK4/6 inhibitor is settled down as the standard
  first line therapy for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and all three CDk4/6 inhibitors,
  palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are currently available for same indications.
  However, there is no effective treatment strategy for patients who have progressed
  on AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor. In particular, the clinical efficacies of subsequent hormone
  therapy are lowered when ESR1 mutations, one of mechanisms of AI resistance occur.
  In the PADA-1 trial, when ESR1 mutations in ctDNA were detected in patients treated
  with AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor, AI was switched to fulvestrant even if disease progression
  was not confirmed clinically. As a result, the median PFS was prolonged by about
  8 months in this switching group compared to the group in which AI was continued.
  The results of this study suggested that delaying the occurrence of ESR1 mutations
  and early response to them are necessary to increase the effectiveness of hormone
  therapy.


  In SWOG S0226 study, fulvestrant + AI combination showed significant benefits in
  PFS and OS compared to AI monotherapy as the first line therapy. Based on these
  results, the NCCN guideline suggests fulvestrant + AI combination as one of the
  first line hormone therapy options. However, the clinical effect of AI + fulvestrant
  + CDK4/6 inhibitor has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the investigators are
  planning to compare the clinical efficacy of AI+ fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor
  and AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor, and to investigate if a triple combination regimen can
  delay the emergence of ESR1 mutations and modulate occurred ESR1 mutations.'
