  biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated'
- '* HIV-infected participants must have well controlled human immunodeficiency virus
  (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART)'
- '* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible
  if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks,
  and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to allocation (Sacituzumab Tirumotecan
  Run-in) or randomization (Phase 3 portion)'
- '* Participants with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if
  HCV viral load is undetectable at screening'

summary: 'This study will have two phases: a sacituzumab tirumotecan safety run-in
  and a Phase 3 portion. The safety run-in phase will be used to evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of sacituzumab tirumotecan at the dose for evaluation in the Phase 3
  portion. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab
  tirumotecan versus treatment of physician''s choice as second-line treatment for
  participants with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in the Phase 3 portion.


  The primary study hypotheses are that, in the Phase 3 portion, sacituzumab tirumotecan
  results in a superior overall survival compared to TPC in participants with high
  trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) expression level and in all participants.'
