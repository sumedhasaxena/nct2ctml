prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion criteria:'
- '* Histologically documented unresectable locally advanced/metastatic non-squamous
  NSCLC'
- '* Part 1: Progression after 1 or 2 lines of systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic
  setting.'
- '* Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: Patients must have tumors that do not harbor known
  genomic alterations or actionable driver kinases, for which approved therapies are
  available are allowed.'
- "* Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: Patient must be treatment-na\xEFve for advanced or\
  \ metastatic NSCLC. Patients who have received prior adjuvant, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy,\
  \ or definitive chemoradiation for advanced disease are eligible, provided that\
  \ progression has occurred \\> 6 months from end of last therapy"
- '* HER2overexpression status as determined by central review of tumor tissue'
- '* WHO / ECOG performance status of 0 or 1'
- '* Measurable target disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST 1.1'
- '* Has protocol defined adequate organ and bone marrow function'
- '* Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: Minimum body weight of 35 kg.'
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- '* HER2 mutation if previously known'
- '* Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has
  current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out
  by imaging at screening'
- '* Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including, but not
  limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder and prior pneumonectomy'
- '* Active primary immunodeficiency known HIV infection, or active chronic and resolved
  hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen \[HBsAg+ve\] or hepatitis
  B virus core antibody (anti-HBc +ve) regardless of HBV DNA level)) or hepatitis
  C infection. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase
  chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA. Patients should be tested for HIV prior
  to treatment assignment if required by local regulations or IRB/EC'
- '* Active infection including tuberculosis and uncontrolled infection requiring
  IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals'
- '* Spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system metastases,
  defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with corticosteroids
  or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms'
- '* Medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before treatment assignment,
  symptomatic CHF (New York Heart Association Class II to IV), clinically important
  cardiac arrhythmias, or a recent (\< 6 months) cardiovascular event including stroke'
- '* For Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: Cardiomyopathy of any etiology, symptomatic CHF
  (as defined by New York Heart Association Class \> II), unstable angina pectoris,
  history of MI within the past 12 months, or cardiac arrhythmia are to be excluded.
  Patients with troponin levels above ULN at screening (as defined by the manufacturer),
  and without any myocardial related symptoms, should have a cardiologic consultation
  before treatment assignment to rule out acute cardiopulmonary events.'
- '* Ascites or pericardial effusion that requires drainage, peritoneal shunt, Pleuroperitoneal
  shunt or CART (Concentrated Ascites Reinfusion Therapy)'
- '* For Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: Active non-infectious skin disease (including
  any grade rash, urticarial, dermatitis, ulceration, or psoriasis) requiring systemic
  treatment, active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring
  chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.'
- "* Unresolved toxicities not yet resolved to Grade \u2264 1 or baseline from previous\
  \ anticancer therapy OR prior discontinuation of any planned study therapy due to\
  \ toxicity."
- '* must not have any medical contraindication to platinum-based chemotherapy.'
- '* Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5 patients must not have had prior exposure to anti-PD-1,
  anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, anti-TIGIT or any other experimental immunotherapy in any
  setting.'
- '* For Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: History of substance abuse or any other medical
  or psychological conditions that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere
  with the subject''s participation in the clinical study or evaluation of the clinical
  study results'
- '* For Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5: History of thromboembolic events within 3 months
  before the first dose of IP (limited to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis,
  or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis).'

summary: DESTINY-Lung03 will investigate the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab
  deruxtecan in combination with Immunotherapy Agents with and without chemotherapy
  in patients with HER2 over-expressing non-small cell lung cancer. The efficacy will
  be also analyzed as a secondary endpoint.
