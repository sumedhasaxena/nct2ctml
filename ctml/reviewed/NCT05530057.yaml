  according to American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists
  guidelines evaluated at a central laboratory'
- '* was previously treated with trastuzumab, T-DM1 or T-Dxd, and taxane (whether
  in recurrent/metastatic setting or neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting).'
- '* Less than 4 prior lines of chemotherapy or HER2 targeted therapies for treatment
  in metastatic disease (\<4 treatment regimens for recurrent/metastatic disease excluding
  adjuvant treatments)'
- '* Documented radiologic progression (during or after most recent treatment or within
  6 months after completing adjuvant therapy).'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, or 1'
- '* Male and female subjects of reproductive/childbearing potential must agree to
  use a highly effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse during and upon
  completion of the study and for at least 4.5 months after the last dose of study
  treatment.'

summary: Optimal salvage treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer after trastuzumab
  and T-DM1 failure still remains to be established. We would like to investigate
  the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy of eribulin and trastuzumab
  as salvage treatment for HER2-Positive breast cancer after exposure to trastuzumab
  and T-DM1
