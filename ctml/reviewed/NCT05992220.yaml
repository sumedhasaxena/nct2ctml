summary: 'The recent global IMbrave150 study evaluated the combination of atezolizumab
  and bevacizumab versus sorafenib in 501 patients with advanced or metastatic Hepatocellular
  Carcinoma (HCC). The median overall survival (OS) was notably better in the atezolizumab/bevacizumab
  group. However, for HCC patients with intrahepatic macrovascular invasion (MVI),
  the prognosis remains poor, indicating a significant unmet need in this group.


  External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) has shown promising results in treating HCC with
  MVI, especially when used in combination with trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE).
  It has been reported that radiotherapy may make tumor cells more susceptible to
  immune-mediated therapy, potentially enhancing the effects of atezolizumab and bevacizumab.


  Thus, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab/bevacizumab
  alone versus atezolizumab/bevacizumab in combination with EBRT in HCC patients with
  macrovascular invasion.'
