  with a Topoisomerase-1 (TOPO1)-inhibitor payload or treatments targeting B7-H3.
- Exclude - * Has known sensitivity to study intervention components or excipients
  or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates
  participation in the study.

  tendency within 1 month prior to the first dose.
- Exclude - * Known active infectious diseases requiring systemic treatment or known
  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
- Exclude - * Has symptomatic brain metastases or untreated progression exclusively
  due to brain metastasis during or after the last treatment prior to screening, evidence
  of leptomeningeal/meningeal/brainstem metastasis or evidence of spinal cord metastases.

summary: '"In this study researchers are testing GSK5764227, a new medicine that targets
  specific proteins (B7-H3) on cancer cells, thereby reducing the cancers ability
  to grow and spread. This study specifically aims to evaluate how well GSK5764227
  works in treating relapsed SCLC compared to standard treatment topotecan, by checking
  whether GSK5764227 makes cancers smaller or disappear completely and if it helps
  participants live longer. The study is also assessing whether GSK576227 is safe
  and tolerated well by participants compared to topotecan and provide a better understanding
  of the main side effects of both drugs. Participants with relapsed SCLC will be
  randomly divided into two groups: one group receiving GSK5764227 and the other receiving
  topotecan."'
