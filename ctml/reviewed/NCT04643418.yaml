summary: This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase
  1/2a study with dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors (Part 1)
  and cohorts of up to 15 patients per selected indication (Part 2). The solid tumor
  types in Part 2 will be decided by the sponsor prior to the start of Part 2, but
  not be solely based on the efficacy results in Part 1.
