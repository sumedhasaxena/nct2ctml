summary: This study is being conducted to learn more about the safety, tolerability,
  and effectiveness of an experimental treatment for metastatic prostate cancer called
  AZD6621. The study is split into different modules which will look at AZD6621 delivered
  by different methods. The study is also further split into 2 parts, Part A which
  will test different dose levels of AZD6621 to determine which doses are the best
  in terms of safety and side effects (dose escalation), and Part B will further test
  at least two AZD6621 doses in a larger group of participants (dose expansion).
