- '* Stage IIIB or IIIC or Stage IV metastatic NSCLC (according to Edition 8 of the
  AJCC staging manual) not amenable to curative surgery or definitive chemoradiation.'
- '* Absence of sensitising EGFR mutations, and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, and absence
  of documented local test result for any other known genomic alteration for which

  cardiac disease.
- Exclude - * Has clinically significant third-space fluid retention (for example
  pleural effusion) and is not amenable for repeated drainage.
- Exclude - * History of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has
  current ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out
  by imaging at screening
- Exclude - * Has significant pulmonary function compromise, as determined by the
  investigator
- Exclude - * Spinal cord compression, or brain metastases unless participant treated
  and no longer symptomatic, radiologically stable, and who require no treatment with
  corticosteroids or anticonvulsants.
