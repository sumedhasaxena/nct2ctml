  mutation
- "Exclude - * Persistent clinically significant toxicities (Grade \u22652) from previous\
  \ anti-cancer therapy except for Grade \\&gt;2 toxicities that are considered unlikely\
  \ to put the participant at an increased risk of treatment-related toxicity and/or\
  \ impact the study results e.g., alopecia"

  unless the symptoms are stable for at least 28 days prior to the first dose of the
  study drug and any symptoms have returned to baseline
- Exclude - * Evidence of abnormal cardiac function
- Exclude - * History of uncontrolled allergic reactions and/or known expected hypersensitivity
  to the study drugs used in the treatment arm to which the participant is to be enrolled
  into
- Exclude - * Any other known active malignancy except for treated cervical intraepithelial
  neoplasia, or non-melanoma skin cancer
- Exclude - * Any uncontrolled illness or significant uncontrolled condition(s) requiring
  systemic treatment
- Exclude - * Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection
- Exclude - * Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breast feeding
- Exclude - * COVID 19 infection within 3 months prior to the first dose of the study
