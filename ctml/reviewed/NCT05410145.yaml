summary: This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation,
  and dose-expansion Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of D3S-001 or combination
  therapy in subjects with advanced KRAS p.G12C mutant solid tumors. D3S-001 will
  be taken daily by oral administration in 21-day treatment cycles.
