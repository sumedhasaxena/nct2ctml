prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC that
  has documented radiographic progression on one or after one prior line of systemic
  treatment (programmed death-1 \[PD-1\]/ programmed death ligand-1 \[PD-L1\] inhibitor
  and platinum-based chemotherapy concomitantly) in advanced/metastatic setting per
  the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, 8th edition.'
- '* Participants must have received minimum two cycles of immunotherapy in first-line
  treatment to be eligible to this trial.'
- '* Only one prior line of immunotherapy containing regimen is allowed in advanced/metastatic
  setting. If participant had received adjuvant immunotherapy the disease-free interval
  (after the last dose of adjuvant immunotherapy) should be at least 6 months.'
- '* Historical PD-L1 results must be available.'
- '* Patients with actionable genetic alterations are allowed to be enrolled if patients
  received locally approved and available targeted agent in combination with immunotherapy
  in first-line advanced/metastatic setting.'
- '* Enrollment of participants with primary resistance (best response being radiological
  progression to prior immunochemotherapy) will be capped under 30% in the overall
  trial population.'
- '* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST v1.1.
  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable
  if progression has been documented after irradiation. Historical images within 28
  days of the Screening Visit may be accepted as a screening image if deemed acceptable
  in the opinion of the investigator.'
- '* Eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Known hypersensitivity to the study treatments, their metabolites or
  formulation of excipients including polysorbate 80 (see Docetaxel label).
- Exclude - * Participants who received prior treatment with anti-vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, or anti-PD-(L)-1/aVEGF bispecific antibody
  or docetaxel as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.
- Exclude - * Have received more than one prior lines of therapies in advanced/metastatic
  setting.
- "Exclude - * Have received systemic corticosteroids (at a dosage greater than 10\
  \ mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroids) within 14\
  \ days prior to the initiation of study treatment (except for docetaxel premedication).\
  \ Note: local, intranasal, intraocular, intra-articular or inhaled corticosteroids,\
  \ short term use (\u22647 days) of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., prevention\
  \ of contrast agent allergy) or treatment of non autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed\
  \ hypersensitivity reactions caused by exposure to allergens) are allowed."
- Exclude - * Have uncontrolled hypertension or poorly controlled diabetic conditions
  prior to study treatment.
- Exclude - * Have a serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. This includes
  history (within 6 months prior to study entry) or risk of abdominal fistula, tracheoesophageal
  fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess or esophageal
  and gastric varices, or acute gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, the participant
  must have undergone correction (or spontaneous healing) of the perforation/fistula
  and/or the underlying process causing the fistula/perforation.
- Exclude - * Participants with evidence of major coagulation disorders or other significant
  risks of hemorrhage.
- Exclude - * Have superior vena cava syndrome or symptoms of spinal cord compression
- 'Exclude - NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'This is a Phase II, multisite, open-label, single arm study with two parts
  in participants with advanced/metastatic NSCLC which progressed after a first-line
  chemoimmunotherapy.


  Part 1 is safety run-in with pumitamig (BNT327) (Dose 1 or Dose 2) plus docetaxel
  and will include up to 12 participants to be treated in Part 1A and 1B sequentially.


  Part 2 is a dose expansion at the deemed safe dose of pumitamig plus docetaxel.'
