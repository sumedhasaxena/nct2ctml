prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, carrying an EGFR
  activating mutation prior to receiving standard EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)'
- '* Phase 1a general inclusion criteria:'
- '* Disease progression on prior third-generation EGFR-TKI for advanced or metastatic
  disease, and either progressed or ineligible for currently available standard-of-care
  treatment (eg, platinum-based chemotherapy) after EGFR-TKI treatment'
- '* Phase 1a safety expansion'
- '* Documentation of EGFR resistance mutations (ie, C797s)'
- "* At least \u2265 1 evaluable lesion (for Phase 1a Dose Escalation) or at least\
  \ \u2265 1 measurable lesion (for Phase 1a Safety Expansion or Phase 1b Dose Expansion)\
  \ per RECIST v1.1"
- '* EGFR resistance mutations may be detected locally either from tumor tissue or
  circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood, and samples used for detection of resistance
  mutations must be collected after progression on the most recent systemic antitumor
  treatment'
- '* Adequate organ function'
- "* Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of \u2264\
  \ 1"
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Any previous histologic or cytologic evidence of small cell or combined
  small cell/non-small cell disease in the archival tumor tissue or tumor biopsy before
  enrollment
- Exclude - * Symptomatic spinal cord compression
- Exclude - * Brain metastases which are symptomatic and/or requiring emergency treatment
  (eg, starting steroid, or stereotactic radiation/whole-brain radiation within 2
  weeks before first dose of study drug)
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with fourth-generation EGFR-TKI, other CDAC/proteolysis-targeting
  chimeras (PROTAC) compounds targeting EGFR mutations, or other drugs with the mechanism
  of action specifically targeting EGFR resistance mutations (eg, C797X) (except for
  the first- to third-generation EGFR-TKIs)
- "Exclude - * Any history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or \u2265 Grade 2 noninfectious\
  \ pneumonitis \u2264 2 years before the first dose of study drug, or has current\
  \ ILD/noninfectious pneumonitis, or where suspected active ILD/noninfectious pneumonitis\
  \ cannot be ruled out by imaging during screening"
- Exclude - * Uncontrollable pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring
  frequent drainage
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a/1b clinical study to evaluate
  the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor
  activity of BG-60366, a highly potent, selective EGFR-mutation targeted Chimeric
  Degradation Activation Compound (CDAC). BG-60366 is designed to degrade mutant EGFR,
  which is a common cause for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). This study will
  evaluate how well BG-60366 works in participants with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutant
  NSCLC.


  The study will be conducted in 2 parts: 1) Phase 1a Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion,
  and 2) Phase 1b Dose Expansion.'
