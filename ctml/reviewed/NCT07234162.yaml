summary: This is a phase 3, open-label, randomized, multinational study to evaluate
  the anti-tumor efficacy of golidocitinib versus investigator's choice in adult patients
  with relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (r/r PTCL). This study will
  treat patients with pathologically confirmed PTCL who have relapsed after or been
  refractory/intolerant to at least one prior systemic treatment regimen(s).
