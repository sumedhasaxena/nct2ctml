prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Female participants only, aged 18 or above'
- '* Participants with advanced solid tumors must have received prior adequate therapy
  in accordance with local practice for their tumor type and stage of disease, or,
  in the opinion of the Investigator, a clinical study is the best option for their
  next treatment based on response to and/or tolerability of prior therapy.'
- '* Metastatic or locoregionally recurrent disease and radiological or objective
  evidence of progression on or after the last systemic therapy prior to starting
  IMP.'
- '* ECOG/WHO performance status 0 to 1, and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.'
- '* At least one lesion that is measurable and/or non-measurable, as per RECIST v1.1
  and that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * Intervention with any of the following:'
- Exclude - * Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or other anti-cancer
  drugs for the treatment of advanced cancer from a previous treatment regimen or
  clinical study within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of the first
  dose of IMP (21 days for myelosuppressive therapies) other than GnRHa (eg, goserelin)
  and bone-stabilizing agents (eg, zoledronic acid, denosumab).
- Exclude - * Any prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products, including
  herbal products, known to be moderate or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/5
  which cannot be discontinued prior to first dose of IMP and withheld throughout
  the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
- Exclude - * Drugs that have a known risk of Torsades de Pointes.
- Exclude - * Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within
  1 week of the first dose of IMP.
- Exclude - * Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury, within 4 weeks
  of the first dose of IMP, or an anticipated need for major surgery and/or any surgery
  requiring general anesthesia during the study.
- "Exclude - * Any unresolved toxicities of Grade \u2265 2 from prior anti-cancer\
  \ therapy (with the exception of alopecia). Participants with stable \u2264 Grade\
  \ 2 neuropathy are eligible."
- Exclude - * Presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, as judged
  by the Investigator, uncontrolled CNS metastatic disease. Participants with spinal
  cord compression and/or brain metastases may be enrolled if definitively treated
  (eg, surgery or radiotherapy) and stable off steroids for at least 4 weeks prior
  to start of IMP.
- Exclude - * Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including
  uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, or eg, infection requiring
  IV antibiotic therapy, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and
  HIV (active viral infection is defined as requiring antiviral therapy; screening
  for chronic conditions is not required).
- 'Exclude - * Any of the following cardiac criteria:'
- Exclude - * Mean resting QTcF \> 470 msec obtained from a triplicate ECG
- Exclude - * Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology
  of resting ECG (eg, complete left bundle branch block, second- and third-degree
  heart block), or clinically significant sinus pause. Participants with controlled
  atrial fibrillation can be enrolled.
- Exclude - * Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
  events such as symptomatic heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome,
  immediate family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death at \< 40
  years of age. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and clinically significant stenotic valve
  disease.
- "Exclude - * LVEF \\< 50%, and/or experience of any of the following procedures\
  \ or conditions in the preceding 6 months: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty,\
  \ vascular stent, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart\
  \ failure NYHA Grade \u2265 2, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack."
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled hypertension.
- 'Exclude - * Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function as demonstrated by
  relevant laboratory values:'
- Exclude - * Refractory nausea and vomiting, uncontrolled chronic gastrointestinal
  diseases, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
  of IMP(s).
- Exclude - * History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of AZD8421
  or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD8421.
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with AZD8421 or with any CDK2-selective inhibitor,
  or protein kinase membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory
  kinase 1 (PKMYT1) inhibitor, or WEE1 inhibitor.
- Exclude - * Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test), breast
  feeding, or planning to become pregnant. Participants of childbearing potential
  must agree to use one highly effective contraceptive measure.
