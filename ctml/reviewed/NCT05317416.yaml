prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Diagnosis of MM as defined according to IMWG criteria (Rajkumar, 2014) with measurable
  disease at diagnosis'
- '* Part 1 patients must be MRD positive, Part 2 patients can be MRD negative or
  MRD positive'
- '* History of induction therapy for newly diagnosed MM, followed by high dose therapy
  and autologous stem cell transplant. Randomization must occur within 120 days from
  the stem cell transplant. For participants who receive consolidation therapy after
  ASCT, randomization must occur within 60 days of consolidation and within 7 months
  from ASCT.'
- '* Partial Response or better according to IMWG criteria at the time of randomization'
- '* Must have an archival bone marrow aspirate sample(s) to identify the dominant
  malignant (index) clone by central laboratory NGS test (ClonoSEQ assay) that is
  used to track MRD status. This sample should preferably be collected before induction
  treatment (eg, at diagnosis) or before transplant.'

- Exclude - * Known active CNS involvement or clinical signs of myelomatous meningeal
  involvement
- Exclude - * Previous MM maintenance treatment
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with BCMA targeted therapy
- Exclude - * Any other active malignancy within 3 years prior to enrollment, except
  for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in
  situ
- Exclude - * Active, uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, including
  (but not limited to) HBV, HCV, and known HIV or AIDS-related illness
- Exclude - * Previous administration with an investigational drug or vaccine within
  30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the
  first dose of study intervention used in this study (whichever is longer)

summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether elranatamab monotherapy
  can provide clinical benefit compared to lenalidomide monotherapy (control) in participants
  with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma after undergoing autologous stem cell transplant.
  In Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, participants in the study will either receive
  elranatamab (arm A and C) as an injection under the skin at the study clinic or
  lenalidomide orally once daily at home (arm B). Participation in the study will
  be approximately five years
