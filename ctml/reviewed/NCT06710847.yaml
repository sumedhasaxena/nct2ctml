- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Parts 1, 2, and 3 inclusion criteria:'
- '* Has a histologically diagnosed advanced (unresectable, metastatic or recurrent)
  solid tumor'
- '* Has a known dMMR/MSI-H status as determined by a certified local laboratory at
  the time of Pre-screening or has an unknown Mismatch repair (MMR)/ Microsatellite
  Instability (MSI) status at the time of Pre-screening and MMR/MSI status will be
  determined by central reference laboratory'
- '* Provides an archival or fresh (preferred) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)
  sample'
- '* Intends to receive GSK4418959 (alone or in combination with PD-1 inhibitor, as
  determined between Investigator and sponsor) as next line of treatment'
- '* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1'
- '* Is expected to have a minimum of 3 months life expectancy'
- '* Has adequate organ function, as defined in the protocol'
- 'Parts 1 and 3 inclusion criteria:'
- "\u2022 Has histologically diagnosed advanced (unresectable, metastatic or recurrent)\
  \ solid tumor and has exhausted all standard of care treatment options"
- 'Part 2 inclusion criteria:'
- '* Has histologically diagnosed advanced (unresectable, metastatic or recurrent)
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) or Endometrial cancer (EC)'
- '* Has received at least 1 but no more than 3 lines of systemic anticancer therapy
  for their advanced (unresectable, metastatic or recurrent) disease including at
  least one line of Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy'
- '* Has measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 target lesion) during the Screening
  period per RECIST 1.1, as determined by the investigator'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Parts 1, 2, and 3 exclusion criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Has not recovered (i.e., to Grade \u22641 or to baseline) from prior\
  \ anticancer therapy-induced AEs"
- Exclude - * Has received prior treatment with a WRN inhibitor
- Exclude - * Is unable to swallow and retain orally administered study treatment
- Exclude - * Has symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases
- Exclude - * Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active
  treatment within the last 2 years because reoccurrence of another malignancy would
  confound interpretation by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma
  of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially
  curative therapy, or in situ cancer that is considered to be low risk for progression
  by the investigator
- Exclude - * Has any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal
  disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drugs
- Exclude - * Has severe liver fibrosis
- Exclude - * Has cirrhosis or current unstable liver or biliary disease
- Exclude - * Has known hypersensitivity to any of the study interventions or any
  of their excipients
- Exclude - * Has known WRN syndrome
- Exclude - * Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
  in the past 2 years
- 'Exclude - Part 3 exclusion criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Has experienced any of the following with prior immunotherapy: any\
  \ immune mediated adverse events (imAE) of Grade \u22653, immune-related severe\
  \ neurologic events of any grade, exfoliative dermatitis of any grade (Stevens-Johnson\
  \ Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic\
  \ signs syndrome \\[DRESS\\] syndrome), or myocarditis of any grade. Non-clinically\
  \ significant laboratory abnormalities are not exclusionary"
- Exclude - * Has any history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

summary: Solid tumours are abnormal lumps of tissue that can occur in different parts
  of the body. The tumours involved in this study have specific genetic characteristics
  that can make them more aggressive and challenging to treat. The study will test
  whether GSK4418959 alone or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor agent can decrease
  tumor size, is safe, well-tolerated, and how amounts of the study drug decrease
  in the body over time.
