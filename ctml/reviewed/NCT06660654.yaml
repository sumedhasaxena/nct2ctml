- 'Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment
  into the trial:'
- "1. Adults \u226518 years of age on the day of signing the ICF."
- 2. Participants must have at least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, amenable
  to biopsy, and must consent to provide a pre-treatment biopsy from a primary and/or
  metastatic lesion.
- 3. Has at least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST version 1.1 per investigator
  assessment.
- 4. Participants must have progressed radiologically on or after their most recent
  line of systemic therapy.
- 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.
- 6. Additional inclusion criteria for endometrial cancer cohort
- 1. Pathologically or cytologically documented endometrial cancer (carcinoma of any
  histological subtype or carcinosarcoma), irrespective of MSI or mismatch repair
  status.
- "2. Documented disease progression after having received \u22651 line of therapy\
  \ (no more than 3), including PBC-containing systemic treatment and an anti-PD-1\
  \ therapy containing regimen (combined or sequential) in the advanced/metastatic\
  \ setting."
- 7. Additional inclusion criteria for cervical cancer cohort
- 1. Pathologically or cytologically documented recurrent or persistent squamous,
  adenosquamous, or adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.
- "2. Disease progression after having received \u22651 prior line of therapy that\
  \ includes systemic therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting."
- 8. Additional inclusion criterion for non-HGSOC cohort
- a. Pathologically or cytologically documented unresectable or metastatic CCOC, low
  grade endometrioid, low-grade serous, or mucinous OVC that was previously treated
  with at least 1 prior line of therapy.
- 9. Additional inclusion criteria for urothelial cancer cohort
- 1. Pathologically or cytologically documented unresectable or metastatic urothelial
  carcinoma of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. Histological variants
  are allowed if urothelial histology is predominant.
- "2. Relapsed or progressed after treatment with \u22651 prior line of therapy (maximum\
  \ of 3) that contains anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in the perioperative or metastatic setting."
- 10. Additional inclusion criterion for the ccRCC cohort a. Pathologically or cytologically
  documented unresectable or metastatic ccRCC that was previously treated with no
  more than 3 prior systemic regimens for locally advanced or metastatic RCC, including
  both a PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI in sequence or in combination.
- 'Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering
  the trial:'
- 1. Clinically active brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal
  carcinomatosis
- '2. Any of the following within the past 6 months prior to enrollment: cerebrovascular
  accident, transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thromboembolic event.'
- 3. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease as specified in the protocol.
- 4. Has a history of (noninfectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required corticosteroids,
  has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled
  out by imaging at screening.
- 5. Clinically severe pulmonary compromise
- 6. Chronic steroid treatment (\>10 mg/day) with exceptions as noted in the protocol.
- 7. History of other active malignancy within 3 years prior to enrollment, with the
  exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (eg, 5-year OS
  rate \>90%) and treated with expected curative outcome.
- "8. Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities\
  \ (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0, Grade \u2264\
  1 or baseline."
- 9. Prior exposure to other CDH6-targeted agents or an ADC that consists of an exatecan
  derivative that is a topoisomerase I inhibitor (eg, trastuzumab deruxtecan, datopotamab
  deruxtecan).
- 10. Evidence of ongoing uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.
- 11. Has active or uncontrolled HIV, HBV, or HCV infection.

summary: This pan-tumor trial is designed as a signal-seeking trial to assess efficacy
  and safety of raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd) monotherapy in locally advanced or
  metastatic solid tumors with various cadherin-6 (CDH6) expression levels, including
  gynecological cancers (endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, and non-high-grade serous
  ovarian cancer) and genitourinary cancers (urothelial cancer and clear cell renal
  cell carcinoma \[ccRCC\]).
