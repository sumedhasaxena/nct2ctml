- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically confirmed, locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic nonsquamous
  NSCLC'
- '* Documented absence of tumor activating EGFR mutation, ALK gene and ROS1 rearrangements,
  and alterations in any actionable driver oncogenes for which there are locally approved
  targeted first-line therapies'
- '* PD-L1 IHC testing documenting TPS \< 49%'
- '* No prior systemic treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC.'
- '* Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1'
- '* ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1'
- "* Life expectancy \u2265 3 months"
- '* Adequate liver, kidney, thyroid and bone marrow function'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous
  meningitis. Patients with treated brain metastases may participate, provided they
  are radiologically stable
- Exclude - * Active known or suspected autoimmune disease
- Exclude - * Has any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids,
  prednisone equivalents, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior
  to first dose of study drug
- Exclude - * Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic
- "Exclude - * Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive with CD4+ T-cell\
  \ (CD4+) count \\< 350 cells/\u03BCL, or an HIV viral load greater than 400 copies/mL,\
  \ or a history of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infection\
  \ within the past 12 months, or not on established antiretroviral therapy (ART)\
  \ for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug dosing. (HIV positive subjects\
  \ who do not meet these exclusion criteria are eligible)"
- Exclude - * Positive test for hepatitis C RNA (a patient who is hepatitis C virus
  \[HCV\] antibody positive but HCV RNA negative due to documented, curative prior
  antiviral treatment or natural resolution is eligible)
- Exclude - * Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B core antibody
  (hBcAb) (a patient whose hBsAg is negative and hBcAb is positive may be enrolled
  if a hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test is negative and the subject is retested for
  HbsAg and HBV DNA every 2 months)
- Exclude - * History or evidence of any clinically unstable/uncontrolled disorder,
  condition, or disease (including, but not limited to, cardiopulmonary, renal, metabolic,
  hematologic, or psychiatric) other than NSCLC, that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
  would pose a risk to patient safety or interfere with study evaluations, procedures,
  or completion
- Exclude - Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.

summary: The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended dose of vudalimab
  to be used in combination with chemotherapy (Part 1) and to evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of vudalimab plus standard of care chemotherapy relative to pembrolizumab
  plus chemotherapy (Part 2) as first-line treatment in patients with nonsquamous
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
