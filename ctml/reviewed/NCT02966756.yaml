summary: This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study, evaluating the efficacy
  of venetoclax in participants with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
  (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) either in presence of 17p deletion (Cohort
  1) or those who have failed a B-receptor signaling pathway inhibitor (BCRI) therapy
  and who have also failed, or were unable to receive chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) irrespective
  of 17p status (Cohort 2).
