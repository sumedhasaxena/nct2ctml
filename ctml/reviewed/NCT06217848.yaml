summary: 'GLP-1 analogs are used as agents in the existing treatment of obesity. However,
  there are lack of previous reports on the effectiveness and role of GLP-1 analogs
  in the development of obesity traits in patients with functionally impaired hypothalamus.
  With this preliminary study, the investigators would explore the role of GLP-1 analogues
  to identify eating behavioral pathology subtype differences in the therapeutic efficacy
  of GLP-1 analogues in hypothalamic obesity patients. This will allow us to identify
  the role of specific nuclei which could be the pathogenesis of hypothalamic obesity.


  Our hypotheses: GLP-1 analogs will effectively induce weight loss in patients with
  hypothalamic obesity, and different subtypes of hypothalamic obesity will respond
  differently to GLP-1 analogs.'
