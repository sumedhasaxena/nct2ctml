summary: "This is a Phase I, open-label study to explore the safety profile and to\
  \ find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum feasible dose (MFD) of Magicell-NK\
  \ in subjects diagnosed with stage I or stage IIa colon cancer post resection from\
  \ a single site in Taiwan.\n\nDuring this study, 3 dose levels of Magicell-NK will\
  \ be tested with a 3+3 design to determine the MTD/MFD: Cohort 1, low dose (2\xD7\
  10\\^8 cells), Cohort 2, middle dose (6\xD710\\^8 cells), and Cohort 3, high dose\
  \ (12\\~18 \xD710\\^8 cells)."
