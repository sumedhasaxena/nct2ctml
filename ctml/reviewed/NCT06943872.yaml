summary: The goal of this study is to compare how well sonrotoclax plus obinutuzumab
  works versus venetoclax plus rituximab in treating adults with relapsed and/or refractory
  (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The study
  will also compare how well sonrotoclax plus rituximab works versus venetoclax plus
  rituxumab in treating adults with R/R CLL/SLL. The safety of these treatments will
  also be assessed.
