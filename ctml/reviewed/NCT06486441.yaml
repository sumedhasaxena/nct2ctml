summary: 'The goal of this clinical study is to find out how the study drug, sacituzumab
  govitecan (SG) works in participants with endometrial cancer who have received prior
  treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, versus the treatment
  of physician''s choice (TPC).


  The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of SG compared to
  TPC on progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central
  review (BICR) and overall survival (OS).'
