prior_treatment_requirements:
- Inclusion criteria
- "1. Age \u2265 18 years"
- 2. Subjects with histological- or cytological-confirmed, advanced cancer who have
  progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard
  anticancer therapy exists
- 1. For Phase 1, all tumor types may be enrolled
- 2. For Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled as per the study design section above
- 3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1
- 4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test (urine
  or serum) within 7 days prior to starting the study drug. Both males and females
  must agree to use effective birth control during the study (prior to the first dose
  and for 6 months after the last dose) if conception is possible during this interval.
- 5. Subjects must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and
  not have any clinically significant GI abnormalities that may alter the absorption,
  such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.
- 6. Able to agree to and sign t he informed consent and to comply with the protocol.
- Exclusion criteria
- 1. Subjects with a history of brain metastases or who have signs/symptoms attributable
  to brain metastases and have not been assessed with radiologic imaging to rule out
  the presence of brain metastases. Subjects with treated brain metastases that are
  asymptomatic and have been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks will be eligible.
- 2. Subjects who have not received vaccines for SARS-COV-2 within last 3 months and
  have suspected signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or a recent history (within 14 days)
  of contact with any COVID-19 positive subject/isolation/quarantine or subjects with
  confirmed COVID-19.
- '3. Subjects with a history of another primary malignancy, other than:'
- 1. Carcinomas in situ, e.g., breast, cervix, and prostate
- 2. Locally excised nonmelanoma skin cancer
- 3. No evidence of disease from another primary cancer for 2 or more years and has
  not taken any anti-cancer treatment in 2 years.
- 4. Any other clinically significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition
  or any laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study drug
  administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.
- 5. Diseases that significantly affect GI absorption of fadraciclib.
- 6. Subjects who have impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac
  disease.
- 7. Presence of active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's
  disease) or GI perforation within 6 months of enrollment
- 8. Presence of an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics
- 9. Presence of known history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 with uncontrolled
  viral load and on medications that may interfere with metabolism
- 10. Presence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- 11. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, extended-field
  radiotherapy, or investigational agents within 5 half-lives or 3 weeks (whichever
  is shorter) prior to administration of first dose of study drug on Day 1 or have
  not recovered from the side effects of such therapy.
- 12. Major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4 weeks of the first dose

summary: This is a 2-part, phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate
  the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, PGx, and efficacy of fadraciclib
  administered orally BID. This study consists of Phase 1 and Phase 2 components in
  subjects with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma who have progressed despite having
  standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.
