summary: The objective of this multi-center, single-group, open-label Phase Ib/II
  study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of nelmastobart
  in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil and bevacizumab in metastatic or recurrent
  colorectal cancer patients with resistance or intolerance to oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based
  chemotherapy, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase
  2 dose (RP2D), and the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in BTN1A1-positive
  patients.
