summary: 'Fluorescence-guided surgery using indocyanine green can visualize the complex
  and diverse lymph node drainage structures for each patient and help determine the
  extent of dissection of the D3 lymph node tailored to the patient. However, since
  fluorescence lymph node mapping (FLNM) is still being conducted only at some institutions
  for research purposes and is limited to reporting the results of small-scale studies
  of patients, a large-scale multi-center study was conducted to verify the clinical-oncological
  effects of FLNM. Research is needed.


  Therefore, this study used real-time fluorescence lymph node mapping (FLNM) to determine
  the extent of D3 lymph node dissection when performing right hemicolectomy and D3
  lymph node dissection in patients with locally advanced right-sided colon cancer
  and to safely remove extensive lymph nodes. We aim to evaluate whether the dissection
  procedure is safe and beneficial in terms of clinical oncology.'
