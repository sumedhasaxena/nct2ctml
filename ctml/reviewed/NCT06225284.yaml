summary: 'Breast cancer (BC), especially premenopausal, is emerging rapidly in East
  Asia in recent 20 years. Half of the breast cancer patients in Asia are younger
  than 50 years of age. In general, younger or premenopausal patients are associated
  with poorer prognosis.


  Premenopausal patients have higher estrogen levels than those in older (postmenopausal)
  patients. Estrogen is known to suppress anti-tumor T cell response and leading to
  tumor progression in different animal models (Clin Cancer Res 2016 22:6204), including
  lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer. One of the mechanisms that contributes to
  estrogen''s suppression of T cell function is via the mobilization of myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSC). Targeting ER signaling with hormonal therapy can abolish
  MDSC mobilization, and sensitize tumor cells to antigen specific T cell or NK cell
  killing (Cancer Discovery 2018 7:72 2017). These study results further support the
  hypothesis that, E2 is associated with immunosuppressive effect, and may contribute
  to the suppression of immune surveillance in young female breast cancer patients.
  These results suggest that E2 may suppress anti-tumor immunity, and E2 reduction
  improve the anti-tumor immunity. In our preliminary works, the investigators found
  higher dose (equivalent to premenopausal women serum level) of E2 suppressed T cell
  activities, while lower dose E2 (postmenopausal serum level) activated T cell activity.
  The investigators have investigated the combination of anti-PD1 antibody and GnRH
  agonist plus exemestane (an aromatase inhibitor which will block the production
  of E2 from adipose tissue) in ER positive premenopausal breast cancer patient refractory
  to prior endocrine therapy in metastatic setting. The response rate was 38.4%, and
  median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.2 months. This outstanding result
  were presented in AACR 2021 oral session (Cancer Res 2021 81:13\_Supplement, CT028).
  On the other hand, progesterone is also well known for its anti-inflammation and
  immune tolerance activity. This possibly makes estrogen reduction treatments, such
  as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist), an important partner in
  augmenting neoadjuvant therapy for patients with premenopausal breast cancer.


  For triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), endocrine therapy has no anti-tumor effect.
  On the other hand, the use of GnRH agonist has been tested for the protection of
  ovary function of young female while receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Surprisingly,
  the concomitant use of goserelin and adjuvant chemotherapy improved disease-free
  survival (HR 0.47, P=0.04) and overall survival (HR 0.45, P=0.05) versus chemotherapy
  alone in ER negative premenopausal early BC patients in POEMS study, which was initially
  aimed to improve the success pregnant rate (N Engl J Med 2015 372;923). Endocrine
  therapy is theoretically antagonist to chemotherapy therapy when concomitantly use.
  In another report analyzed the outcome of both pre- and postmenopausal women who
  entered two randomized trials (Gruppo Oncologico Nord-Ovest-Mammella Intergruppo
  studies) on adjuvant chemotherapy and received either concomitant or sequential
  hormonal therapy. The result showed a decreasing trend (P = 0.015) in hazard ratio
  of death with increasing age was observed, indicating that concomitant therapy is
  more effective than sequential therapy in young patients (Annals of Oncology 2008;19(2):299-307).
  These results support the hypothesis that, E2 suppression/ER inhibition therapy
  may modulate immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing the chemotherapy induced
  immunogenic death effect.


  The investigators hypothesized that, estrogen level reduction by ovarian function
  suppression can modulate immune microenvironment, thereby augmenting adjuvant chemotherapy
  efficacy, regardless of the estrogen receptor (ER) status of cancer cell. Therefore,
  the investigators plan to test this hypothesis in real clinical model, with standard
  clinical recommended treatment doses.


  The study is designed to evaluate whether the GnRH agonist can provide the therapeutic
  benefit for premenopausal TNBC patients via modulating immune microenvironment.
  Premenopausal TNBC patients will receive GnRH agonist and neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
  and the efficacy and immune microenvironment change of co-administration arm will
  be measured and compared with chemotherapy alone control arm.'
