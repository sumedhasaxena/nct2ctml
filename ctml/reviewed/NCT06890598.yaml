- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histological or cytological confirmation of NSCLC.'
- '* Part A'
- 1. Clinical Stage II-IIIB (N2) treated with presurgical chemoimmunotherapy, with
  residual tumor present at time of surgery. Patients with a pathologic complete response
  are not eligible.
- 2. Pathologic Stage II-IIIB (N2) NSCLC treated with initial upfront resection.
- '* Part B - Clinical Stage III, unresectable NSCLC, without progression on concurrent
  platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.'
- '* Must have disease with evidence of KRAS G12C mutation.'
- '* Must have known programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression'
- '* Must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Able to swallow oral medication.'
- '* Must have adequate laboratory parameters.'
- '* Contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations for those participating
  in clinical studies.'
- '* Women of childbearing potential must'
- '* Have a negative pregnancy test.'
- '* Not be breastfeeding during treatment'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Have known changes in the EGFR or ALK genes.
- Exclude - * Have another type of cancer that is progressing or required active treatment
  within the past 3 years before screening.
- Exclude - * Have an active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in
  the past 2 years. Endocrine replacement therapy is allowed.
- Exclude - * Had any immune-related side effect or allergic reaction (Grade 3 or
  higher) from a previous immunotherapy medicine, or any immune-related side effect
  greater than Grade 1 that has not resolved. This does not apply for people with
  hormone-related diseases who are now on stable hormone replacement therapy.

summary: The main purpose of this study is to assess if olomorasib in combination
  with pembrolizumab is more effective than the pembrolizumab and placebo combination
  in part A in participants with resected KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC and to assess if
  olomorasib in combination with durvalumab is more effective than the durvalumab
  and placebo combination in part B in participants with unresectable KRAS G12C-mutant
  non-small cell lung cancer. The study may last up to 3 years for each participant.
