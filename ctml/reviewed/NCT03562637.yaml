- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Documented radiographic and histopathologic confirmed primary localized invasive
  breast cancer.'
- "* Histologically documented TNBC (estrogen receptor negative \\[ER-\\]/progesterone\
  \ receptor negative \\[PR-\\]/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative \\[HER2-\\\
  ]) defined as ER-negative and PR-negative (\u22645% positive cells stain by IHC\

  \ of slides/tumor tissue blocks are provided in the protocol and study Lab Manual."
- '* No evidence of metastatic disease in chest, abdomen and pelvis by CT or other

  for anthracycline treatment) either in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (e.g.,
  National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended regimens):.'
- "* Randomization must occur (a) within 16 weeks after definitive surgery and radiation\
  \ therapy (if radiation therapy administered) in patients who received neoadjuvant\
  \ multiagent chemotherapy or, (b) for patients receiving adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy\
  \ (not including capecitabine, immune checkpoint inhibitor), within 16 weeks after\
  \ the completion of the adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (if\
  \ radiation therapy administered). Note: patients may be randomized and initiate\
  \ study treatment concurrent with adjuvant SOC therapy (observation, capecitabine,\
  \ immune checkpoint inhibitor \xB1 capecitabine)."

  \ therapy (if radiation therapy administered) in patients who received neoadjuvant\

  (have documented sterilization, bilateral oophorectomy/salpingectomy at least 3
  months before the start of the trial and/or hysterectomy), or one year postmenopausal;
  or if of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum)
  at screening.'
- '* Males and females of childbearing potential and their partners must be willing
  to use effective contraception during the entire Treatment Phase and for at least
  4 weeks (28 days) after the last dose of study treatment.'
- '* Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined below:'
- "* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651,500/\xB5L"
- "* Platelets \u226575,000/\xB5L"
- "* Hemoglobin \u22658.5g/dL"
- "* Serum creatinine \u22641.5 \xD7 upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine\
  \ clearance \u226555 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels \\>1.5 \xD7 institutional\
  \ ULN (glomerular filtration rate can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine\
  \ clearance may be calculated per institutional standard)"

  \ ULN"
- "* Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) \u22642.5 \xD7 ULN"

  invasive breast cancer within 10 years prior to randomization \[for synchronous
  tumors see Exclusion criteria #3\]'
