  \ \u226414 days, or palliative radiation of a single lesion \u22647 days prior to\
  \ first dose of study treatment."
- "3. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) \u226428 days prior to\
  \ first dose of study treatment."
- 4. All prescribed medication, over-the-counter medication, vitamin preparations
  and other food supplements, or herbal medications that are strong or moderate CYP3A4
  inducers or inhibitors within 7 days prior to first dose.
- "3. Have any unresolved toxicity of Grade \u22652 from previous anticancer treatment\
  \ in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, except for Grade 2 alopecia or skin pigmentation.\
  \ Patients with other chronic but stable Grade 2 toxicities may be allowed to enroll\
  \ after agreement between the investigator and Sponsor."
- 4. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, treatment-related pneumonitis
  (any grade), or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.
- '5. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease, including
  any of the following:'
- 1. History of congestive heart failure (CHF) Class III/IV according to the New York
  Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification .
- 2. Serious cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment.
- 3. Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) \>470 msec calculated using Fridericia's
  formula (QTcF).
- 6. Unable to swallow tablets or has any disease or condition that may significantly
  affect gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of zipalertinib (such as inflammatory bowel
  disease, malabsorption syndrome, or prior GI resection).
- "7. History of another primary malignancy \u22642 years prior to the date of first\
  \ dose of study treatment unless at least one of the following criteria are met:"
