summary: In a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, open-label and Phase III Radotinib
  clinical study, chronic phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia patients with failure
  or intolerance to previous TKIs therapy including Imatinib will be recruited. In
  this phase 3 study, 173 subjects are expected to be enrolled in a single arm with
  the administration of Radotinib 400mg twice daily, which includes 10% of dropout
  rate.

        Dose modification is allowed if the subject cannot comply with the protocol-defined
        dosing schedule due to hematologic or non-hematologic toxicities and toxicities
        resolve within 28 days (within 42 days for hematologic toxicities). For radotinib,
