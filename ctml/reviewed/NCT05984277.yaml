prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented squamous or non-squamous NSCLC.'
- '* Stage IV NSCLC (according to Version 8 of the IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic
  Oncology 2016), not amenable to curative surgery or radiation.'
- '* Absence of sensitizing EGFR mutations and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.'
- '* Absence of documented tumor genomic alteration results from tests conducted as
  part of standard local practice in any other actionable driver oncogenes for which
  there are locally approved targeted first-line therapies.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC histology or sarcomatoid variant.
  Rare subtypes are excluded.
- Exclude - * Spinal cord compression.
- Exclude - * Symptomatic brain metastases. Brain metastases may be treated or untreated,
  but participants must be asymptomatic and off steroids for at least 14 days prior
  to start of study intervention. A minimum of 2 weeks must have elapsed between the
  end of brain radiotherapy and study enrollment.
- 'Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for:'
- "Exclude - 1. Malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease\
  \ \u2265 2 years before the first dose of study intervention and of low potential\
  \ risk for recurrence."
- Exclude - 2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without
  evidence of disease.
- Exclude - 3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.
- Exclude - * As judged by the investigator, any condition that would interfere with
  evaluation of the study intervention or interpretation of participant safety or
  study results.

summary: The purpose of eVOLVE-Lung02 is to test the effectiveness (efficacy) and
  measure the safety of volrustomig in combination with chemotherapy compared with
  pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as 1L treatment in participants with
  mNSCLC in PD-L1 \< 50%.
