summary: This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial.
  It aims to investigate if the early introduction of intensified chemotherapy (3
  months of modified FOLFIRINOX) improves the 3-year disease-free survival rate compared
  to standard treatment (FOLFOX/CAPOX for an additional three months to complete six
  months of standard adjuvant chemotherapy) in patients with stage 2-3 colon cancer
  in whom ctDNA MRD in the part 1 study remained positive during adjuvant FOLFOX/CAPOX
  chemotherapy
