  or spinal cord compression
- Exclude - * History of other malignancy within the past 2 years
- Exclude - * Ongoing or active infection (including chronic or localized)

- Exclude - * Positive hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C virus ribonucleic
  acid (RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
- Exclude - * History of non-infectious/immune-checkpoint inhibitor related pneumonitis
  that required corticosteroids, or current or suspected pneumonitis that cannot be
  ruled out by imaging at screening.
- Exclude - * Anticancer therapies including radiotherapy (with the exception of palliative
  radiation) chemotherapy or molecularly targeted treatments or tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  (TKI) within 4 weeks of administration of the first dose of AMG 305; checkpoint
  inhibitor therapy within 3 months of the first dose of AMG 305; or other immunotherapies/monoclonal

  dose of study treatment
- Exclude - * Autoimmune disorders requiring chronic systemic steroid therapy or any
  other form of immunosuppressive therapy while on study (eg, ulcerative colitis,
  Crohn's disease)
- Exclude - * Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines received within 28 days (or longer,
  if required locally) prior to the first dose of AMG 305
- Exclude - * Participants with unresolved toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapies
  to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grade 1 or
  better, with the exception of alopecia and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, which

  the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to participant
  safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion

summary: 'The primary objective of this study is to:


  * Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 305 in adult participants

  * Determine the optimal biologically active dose (OBD), at or below the maximum
  tolerated dose (MTD) with MTD 1 as the maximum tolerated starting dose and MTD 2
  as the maximum tolerated target dose

  * Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)'
