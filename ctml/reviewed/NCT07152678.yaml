summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if adding high-dose-rate (HDR)
  brachytherapy can improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have already received external beam radiotherapy
  (EBRT), chemotherapy, and the immune therapy drug nivolumab.


  The main questions it aims to answer are:


  * Does HDR brachytherapy reduce the chance of the cancer coming back in the esophagus
  or nearby areas within 12 months?

  * What side effects or safety issues occur when HDR brachytherapy is given after
  EBRT, chemotherapy, and nivolumab?


  Participants will:


  * Receive 1-2 sessions of HDR brachytherapy delivered through a thin tube placed
  inside the esophagus, within three weeks after starting nivolumab.

  * Continue nivolumab and be monitored with regular follow-up visits, imaging tests,
  and blood samples to check treatment response and safety.'

        equal 100% of prescription. It is NOT allowed to give concurrent chemotherapy
        on the days of HDR brachytherapy.
