summary: This study will prospectively enroll a total of 1000 patients (200 per year)
  simple hyperplasia/complex hyperplasia (SH/CH) without atypia. All subjects will
  receive education for exercise and weight control and be randomized 1:1 to with
  or without metformin intervention. At the end of this 3-year project, an interim
  analysis will be performed. Since long-term follow-up is intended, therefore for
  the 4th to 6th year a new grant support will be looked for. The long-term occurrence
  of endometrial cancer (up to15 years) data will be acquired from national cancer
  registry, which permission is addressed in the informed sent.
