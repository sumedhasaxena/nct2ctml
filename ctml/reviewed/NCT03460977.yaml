summary: 'The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the
  study medicine (called Mevrometostat) for the possible treatment of Relapsed/ Refractory
  Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) and Follicular
  Lymphoma (FL). The study consists of 3 parts; Part 1 and 2 enrolled participants
  with SCLC, metastatic CRPC, and FL are closed for enrollment.


  Part 3, which is open for enrollment is seeking men who:


  * have Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) and

  * have previously received treatment for CRPC and have progressed from the last
  treatment


  All participants in Part 3 of this study will receive mevrometostat and/ or enzalutamide.
  Part 3 consists of 2 sub studies each has an assessment phase and a maintenance
  phase.


  In the assessment phase:


  * participants in the BE substudy will take 3 single doses of mevrometostat by mouth
  over 3 periods.

  * participants in the DDI substudy will take mevrometostat 2 times a day, with or
  without enzalutamide 1 time a day, and/or itraconazole 1 time a day based on a present
  schedule.


  After completion of the assessment phase, participants will enter the maintenance
  phase where they will receive mevrometostat 2 times a day and enzalutamide 1 time
  a day by mouth until their cancer is no longer responding.


  The studywill look at the experiences of participanrs receiving the study medicine.
  This will help see if the study medicine is safe and effective.'
