summary: 'The Phase I part of the study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and
  tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab for treatment of Relapsed or Refractory
  B cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (R/R B-ALL), to determine the maximum
  tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of SC administered
  blinatumomab.


  The Phase II part of the study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability
  of SC blinatumomab for treatment of R/R B-ALL and Minimum Residual Disease Positive
  (MRD+) B-ALL in participants 12 years old and greater. It will also conduct a clinical
  pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of SC1 and SC2 blinatumomab formulations.'

      arm_description: Cohorts of at least 3 adult participants with R/R B-ALL will
        be treated with escalating doses of blinatumomab to determine the maximum
        tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be defined as the dose for which the estimate
        of the toxicity rate from an isotonic regression (Yan et al, 2017) is closest
        to the target toxicity rate. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics
        (PD) and efficacy will be assessed.
