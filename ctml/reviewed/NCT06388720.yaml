  who received proper BCG treatment but did not respond to BCG
- 5. Patients who are not eligible for a radical bladder resection or who have refused
  surgery.
- 6. Patient who are not being pregnant or breast feeding until the study period.

  cell tissue is present (primary squamous cell carcinoma, primary adenocarcinoma,
  small cell carcinoma, sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, paraganglioma, melanoma, lymphoma)
- Exclude - 6. In the case of receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy for other
  cancers within 3 years
- Exclude - 7. If patient have a history of pelvic radiation therapy for other cancers
  within 3 years

  the bladder within 3 years. The exception is cases used for the purpose of injection
  therapy of anticancer drugs in the early bladder cancer
- Exclude - 9. If patient has a history of allergy to mitomycin-c or gemcitabine
- Exclude - 10. Cystoscopy shows a tumor in the prostate urethra
- Exclude - 11. Patients who have participated in studies using clinical trial drugs
  and are currently receiving clinical trial drugs or who have used clinical trial
  drugs or clinical trial medical devices within 4 weeks prior to the date of initial
  treatment
- Exclude - 12. After post-cystoscopy/TURBT, the patient received intravesical chemotherapy
  prior to the start of trial treatment
- Exclude - 13. Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy or bleeding tendency patient.
