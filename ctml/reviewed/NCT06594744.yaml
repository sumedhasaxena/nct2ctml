summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether endoscopic variceal
  ligation (EVL) or carvedilol is more effective at preventing the first esophageal
  variceal bleeding (EVB) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It will
  also learn about the safety of EVL and carvedilol in patients with HCC. The main
  questions it aims to answer are:


  Whether EVL or carvedilol is more effective at preventing initial EVB in patients
  with HCC with high-risk EVs.


  What medical problems do participants have when undergoing EVL or taking carvedilol?
  Researchers will compare the efficacy and safety of EVL to carvedilol for the prevention
  of first EVB in patients with HCC.


  Participants will:


  Undergo EVL every 3-4 weeks until variceal eradication and then receive regular
  endoscopic follow-up according to the protocol, or Take carvedilol every day (start
  from 6.25 mg/d and then titrate to 12.5 mg/d if tolerable).


  Visit the clinic once every 2-3 months for checkups and tests. Keep a diary of their
  vital signs (SBP, DBP, and HR) as well as symptoms.'

      arm_description: EVL will be performed and repeated every 3 to 4 weeks until
        the EVs are eradicated. Following this, patients will undergo regular upper
        gastrointestinal endoscopic surveillance, initially every three months for
        a total of two sessions, then every six months for a total of two sessions,
        and subsequently annually. If EVs are found to recur during surveillance,
        additional EVL will be performed every 3 to 4 weeks until the varices are
        again eradicated endoscopically.

      arm_description: The initial dosage of carvedilol is set at 6.25 mg daily. In
        the absence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure \< 90 mmHg), bradycardia
        (resting heart rate \< 55 beats per minute), or other adverse effects, hospitalized
        patients may have their dosage increased to 12.5 mg daily after 3 days, while
        outpatient patients may increase their dosage to 12.5 mg daily after 7 days.
        This dosage represents the target dose for the trial.
