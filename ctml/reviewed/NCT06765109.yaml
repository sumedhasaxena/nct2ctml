  multimodality treatment) or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
- 2. Documented Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangement via testing of tissue
  or blood
- 3. No prior systemic anticancer treatment for NSCLC (adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  allowed if 12 months prior to randomization; prior ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor

  ALK.
- Exclude - 2. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to excipients of neladalkib or alectinib.
- Exclude - 3. Ongoing or recent radiotherapy as per protocol-specified timeframes
  prior to randomization
- Exclude - 4. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to randomization
- Exclude - 5. Uncontrolled clinically relevant infection requiring systemic therapy
- Exclude - 6. Known active tuberculosis, or active Hepatitis B or C
- Exclude - 7. QT corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \> 470 msec
  on repeated assessments
- Exclude - 8. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease
- Exclude - 9. Brain metastases associated with progressive neurological symptoms
  or requiring increasing doses of corticosteroids to control CNS disease
- Exclude - 10. Active malignancy requiring therapy within 2 years prior to randomization
