- Type of Subject and Disease Characteristics
- 1. Subjects may be male or female and must be equal to or greater than 12 years

  \ 0-2, and either Lansky performance status of 50-100% (\\<16 years old), or Karnofsky\
  \ performance status 50-100% (\u226516 years old). Subjects who are unable to walk\
  \ because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair will be considered ambulatory\
  \ for the purpose of assessing the performance score."

  \ count (ANC) \u2265 750/mcL ii. Platelet count \u2265 75,000/mcL (transfusion independent)\

  \ informed consent document if \u2265 18 years of age and an assent document if\
  \ \\< 18 years of age (per country)."
- '9. Renal laboratory inclusion:'
- 10. Relapsed osteosarcoma (first, second, third or any relapse, subject who have
  recovered from chemotherapy and any other investigational drug/agent treatment,

  \ hypertension (\u2265150/90mmHg), unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction\
  \ (\u2264 6 months prior to screening), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, clinically\
  \ significant cardiac valvulopathy requiring treatment, serious chronic gastrointestinal\

  \ consent"

  \ based on electrocardiogram (ECG)and Doppler ECHO and MUGA results at screening\
