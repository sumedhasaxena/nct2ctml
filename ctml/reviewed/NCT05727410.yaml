prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Subjects with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed resectable, clinically
  node-positive high grade salivary gland carcinoma Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Tubular/cribriform
  pattern predominant, Solid pattern \> 30% Poorly differentiated carcinoma Mucoepidermoid
  carcinoma, High grade Polymorphous adenocarcinoma, High grade Lymphoepithelial carcinoma
  Salivary duct carcinoma Adenocarcinoma, NOS, High grade Carcinosarcoma Squamous
  cell carcinoma Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma - risk is determined by type of
  carcinoma and extent of invasion'
- '* No previous chemotherapy treatment history'
- '* Patients who have at least 1 measurable or non-measurable lesion per the RECIST
  Guideline Ver. 1.1 as confirmed by imaging within 28 days before the first does
  of investigational product.'
- '* Strongly encourage (but not must) to provide newly obtained core or excisional
  biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously treated.'
- '* ECOG Performance Status Score 0 or 1'
- '* Patients with a life expectancy of at least 3 months'
- '* Patients whose latest laboratory data meet the below criteria within 28 days
  before the first dose of the investigational product. If the date of the laboratory
  tests at the time of enrollment is not within 28 days before the first dose of the
  investigational product, testing must be repeated within 28 days before the first
  dose of the investigational product, and these latest laboratory tests must meet
  the following criteria.'
- "* White blood cells \u22652,000/mm3 and neutrophils \u22651,500/mm3"
- "* Platelets \u226550,000/mm3"

  \ study site"
- "* Total bilirubin \u22641.5-fold the ULN of the study site"
- "* Creatinine \u22641.5-fold the ULN of the study site or creatinine clearance (either\
  \ the measured or estimated value using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) \\>45 mL/min"
- '* Women of childbearing potential (including women with chemical menopause or no
  menstruation for other medical reasons) #1 must agree to use contraception#2 from
  the time of informed consent until 5 months or more after the last dose of the investigational
  product. Women must agree to use contraception#2 from the time of informed consent
  until 6 months or more after the last dose of docetaxel and 14 months or more after
  the last dose of cisplatin. Also, women must agree not to breastfeed from the time
  of informed consent until 5 months or more after the last dose of the investigational
  product. Women must agree not to breastfeed from the time of informed consent until
  1 week or more after the last dose of docetaxel. Cisplatin has been reported to
  be found in human milk; women must agree not to breastfeed while receiving cisplatin.'
- '* Men must agree to use contraception#2 from the start of study treatment until
  7 months or more after the last dose of the investigational product, until 3 months
  or more after the last dose of docetaxel, and until 11 months or more after the
  last dose of cisplatin.'
- "* Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women after the onset of menstruation\
  \ who are not postmenopausal and have not been surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy,\
  \ bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy). Postmenopause is defined as\
  \ amenorrhea for \u226512 consecutive months without specific reasons. Women using\
  \ oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or mechanical contraception such as\
  \ contraceptive barriers are regarded as having childbearing potential."
