summary: 'CRC is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed worldwide with developed
  countries at highest risk. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events
  and change in disease activity when telisotuzumab adizutecan is given in combination
  with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil (5FU), leucovorin (LV) (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab
  or panitumumab.


  Telisotuzumab adizutecan is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment
  of mCRC. Fluorouracil and leucovorin are drugs approved for the treatment of mCRC.
  This study will be divided into two stages, with the first stage treating participants
  with increasing doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with FOLFOX and bevacizumab or
  5FU/LV and panitumumab until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious.
  Participants will then be randomized into 3 groups called treatment arms where one
  group will receive one of two optimized doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan from the
  dose escalation phase with FOLFOX and bevacizumab or 5FU/LV and panitumumab, or
  a comparator of FOLFOX and bevacizumab or panitumumab. Approximately 390 adult participants
  with mCRC will be enrolled in the study in 100 sites worldwide.


  In the dose escalation stage participants will be treated with increasing intravenous
  (IV) doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan with FOLFOX and bevacizumab or 5FU/LV and
  panitumumab until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious.
  In the dose optimization stage participants will be receive FOLFOX or receive 5FU/LV,
  but with one of two optimized doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan, or a comparator
  of FOLFOX and bevacizumab/pantitumumab. The study will run for a duration of approximately
  6 years.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
