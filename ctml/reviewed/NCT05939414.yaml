prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion criteria:'
- 1. Histologically confirmed prostate cancer prior to randomization
- '2. Participants must have biochemically recurrent disease after definitive treatment
  to prostate by Radical Prostatectomy ((RP), (alone or with post-operative radiation
  to prostate bed/pelvic nodes)) or External beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), (prostate
  alone or prostate with seminal vesicle and/or pelvic nodes) and/or brachytherapy
  prior to randomization. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is defined as: nadir PSA +
  2 ng/mL post XRT (if participant received-radiation therapy to intact prostate)
  and PSA \> 0.2 ng/mL and rising post RP (with or without post-operation Radiation
  Therapy (RT))'
- 3. Participants must have OMPC with 1-5 PSMA -positive metastatic lesions on screening
  PSMA PET/CT scan (with either gallium (68Ga) gozetotide or piflufolastat (18F))
  as visually assessed by BIRC. For definition of PSMA PET positivity, please refer
  to Section 8.1 and the Imaging Manual. Metastatic lesions may include regional/pelvic
  lymph nodes (N1), distant lymph nodes (M1a), bone (M1b), lung and others visceral
  (M1c) except liver and brain classified using American Joint Committee on Cancer
  (AJCC) 8. When counting the number of oligometastatic lesions, each lesion is counted
  as distinct metastasis irrespective of its anatomical location (e.g., one pelvic
  and one extra-pelvic lymph node will be counted as two metastatic lesions)
- 4. At least 1 PSMA-positive lesion must be a distant metastasis (M1) per AJCC8 classification
  at screening. For AJCC M staging, PSMA PET/CT information should be used
- 5. Participants must have a negative CI for M1 disease at screening.
- 'Note:'
- '* For a participant not to be eligible, CI positive M1 lesions should be unequivocal
  in CI scans, i.e., potentially not attributable to findings thought to represent
  something other than tumor (e.g., degenerative, or post-traumatic changes or Paget''s
  disease in bone lesions). For CI assessments, bone lesions must be assessed by bone
  scan only and soft tissue lesions must be assessed by CT/MRI scans only at screening.'
- '* Prior knowledge of PSMA PET positivity should not influence the radiologist (reader)
  in determination of CI positivity. Two different readers will be involved, one reader
  for PSMA PET/CT scan and one reader for CI: Reader will be blinded to PSMA PET scan
  results while reading CI scans. Reader should not modify their assessment of CI
  scans (e.g. changing a lesion previously identified as equivocal in CI to unequivocal)
  after reading the PSMA PET scan. Similarly, biopsy positivity should not influence
  the reader in the assessment of CI positivity. More details on the reading paradigm
  will be provided in the imaging charter'
- '* MRI for radiation treatment planning may show M1 disease but this will not exclude
  the participant from the study if the lesion is deemed negative per baseline CT
  or bone scans'
- '* Participants with pelvic disease (N1) seen in CI are allowed if the local spread
  is below common iliac bifurcation (per AJCC 8 definition of local disease)'
- '* Distant lymph node disease (M1a) that is visible per CI and less than 10mm in
  the short axis is not exclusionary irrespective of PSMA PET positivity.'
- '* If a previously surgically removed lesion was unequivocal for M1 by bone scan
  or CT, the participant is not eligible.'
- 6. All metastatic lesions detected at screening must be amenable to SBRT
- 7. Non-castration testosterone level \>100 ng/dL at screening
- 'Key Exclusion criteria:'
- 1. Participants with de novo OMPC at screening
- '2. Unmanageable concurrent bladder outflow obstruction or urinary incontinence
  at screening. Note: participants with bladder outflow obstruction or urinary incontinence,
  which is manageable and controlled with best available standard of care (incl. pads,
  drainage) are allowed'
- '3. Prior therapy with:'
- 1. ADT (including bilateral orchiectomy) and ARPIs used for metastatic prostate
  cancer treatment
- "* Participants who received AR-directed therapy, whether ADT or an ARPI or both,\
  \ as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy as a component of their primary therapy, are\
  \ eligible provided that they discontinued therapy \u226512 months prior to randomization\
  \ for ADT (i.e., 12 months after the last day of the last injection) or \u22653\
  \ months if ARPI was given as monotherapy. ARPI's as a term includes both contemporary\
  \ androgen synthesis inhibitors (e.g., abiraterone, galeterone, and orteneronel),\
  \ and receptor inhibitors (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide)."
- '* Patients who biochemically relapsed after primary therapy may also have had treatment
  with AR directed therapy and participants who had SBRT with ADT are also eligible
  provided that the ARPI +/- ADT or ADT alone was terminated'
- "\u226512 months prior to randomization for ADT (i.e., 12 months after the last\
  \ day of the last injection) or \u22653 months if ARPI was given as monotherapy."
- "* Participants who received first generation anti-androgens (bicalutamide, flutamide,\
  \ nilutamide, cyproterone) for biochemical recurrence or adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy\
  \ are eligible provided that they discontinued therapy \u22653 months prior to randomization."
- '* Participants who have discontinued ADT due to disease progression are not eligible
  (i.e., Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) participants)'
- 2. Other hormonal therapy. e.g.,
- "\u2022Use of estrogens, 5-\u03B1 reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride),\
  \ other steroidogenesis inhibitors (aminoglutethimide) if used in the context of\
  \ prostate cancer treatment. Same medications are allowed if used for other indications:\
  \ e.g., Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), if stopped \u22653 months before randomization."
- 3. Radiopharmaceutical agents (e.g., Strontium-89, PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy)
- 4. Immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucel-T)
- 5. Chemotherapy, except if administered in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting completed
  \> 12 months before randomization
- 6. Any other investigational or systemic agents for metastatic disease
- 4. Radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy within
  28 days before randomization
- 5. Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radioligand therapy, hormonal
  therapy (see ADT initiation guidance in Section 6.8.2), Poly Adenosine Diphosphate-Ribose
  Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, biological therapy or investigational therapy
- 6. Diagnosed at screening with other malignancies that are expected to alter life
  expectancy or may interfere with disease assessment. However, participants with
  a prior history of malignancy that has been adequately treated and who have been
  disease/treatment free for more than 3 years are eligible, as are participants with
  adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer and superficial bladder cancer.
- '7. History or current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities indicating significant risk
  of safety for participants participating in the study such as:'
- '* Concomitant clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. sustained ventricular
  tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree Atrioventricular
  (AV) block without a pacemaker'
- '* History of familial long QT syndrome or known family history of Torsades de Pointe'
- 8. Participants in immediate need of ADT as assessed by the investigator.
- Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.

summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lutetium
  (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (AAA617) in participants with oligometastatic prostate
  cancer (OMPC) progressing after definitive therapy to their primary tumor. The data
  generated from this study will provide evidence for the treatment of AAA617 in early-stage
  prostate cancer patients to control recurrent tumor from progressing to fatal metastatic
  disease while preserving quality of life by delaying treatment with androgen deprivation
  therapy (ADT).
