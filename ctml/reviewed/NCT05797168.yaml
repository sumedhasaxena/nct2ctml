prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Core Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the
  requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol.'
- '* Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed
  consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports
  Genomic Initiative. Participants who do not provide informed consent for Optional
  Genetic Research may still be enrolled in the study.'
- "* Participant must be \u2265 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent."
- '* Willing to provide adequate archival and/or baseline tumor sample as applicable
  per module-specific criteria.'
- '* For participants who have previously received targeted therapies such as ADCs,
  a fresh baseline biopsy will be required unless the most recent archival tissue
  sample was collected after receipt of such treatment.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.'
- '* Participants with advanced solid tumors must have received prior adequate therapy
  in accordance with local practice for their tumor type and stage of disease, or,
  in the opinion of the Investigator, a clinical trial is the best option for the
  next treatment based on response and/or tolerability to prior therapy. Participants
  with contraindications or who refuse therapy in accordance with local practice may
  also be considered provided that it is documented that he/she was informed about
  all therapeutic options.'
- '* Participants must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1,'
- 1. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion
  is progressing and well defined.
- 2. For participants who undergo biopsies at screening and/or on treatment, it is
  preferred though not required, that the biopsied lesion, be distinct from any target
  lesion used in the RECIST v1.1 evaluation.
- "* Life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks."
- '* Adequate organ and marrow function.'
- '* Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
  regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.'
- '(a) Male participants: (i) Male participants who are sexually active with a female
  partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom (plus an additional contraceptive
  method) post-screening through 5 months following the last dose of study intervention.
  It is strongly recommended for the female partner of a male participant to also
  use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. In addition,
  male participants must refrain from freezing or donating sperm while on study and
  for 5 months following the last dose of study intervention.'
- '(b) Female participants: (i) Females of childbearing potential must have a negative
  urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose
  of study intervention and a negative urine or serum pregnancy test prior to starting
  their next cycle of treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed
  as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.'
- "(ii) (ii) Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements: Highly effective birth control\
  \ methods include: Total sexual abstinence is an acceptable method provided it is\
  \ the usual lifestyle of the participant (defined as refraining from heterosexual\
  \ intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments)\
  \ \\[(periodic abstinence e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation\
  \ methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study intervention,\
  \ and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\\], a vasectomized\
  \ partner, Implanon\xAE, bilateral tubal occlusion, intrauterine device/levonorgestrel\
  \ intrauterine system, Depo Provera\u2122 injections, oral contraceptive associated\
  \ with inhibition of ovulation, and Evra Patch\u2122, Xulane\u2122, or NuvaRing\xAE\
  ."
- Female participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized
  male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control (defined
  as one that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently
  and correctly), from enrolment throughout the study and for 8 months following the
  last dose of study intervention. The male partner of a female participant of childbearing
  potential must also use a male condom (plus spermicide, if available) throughout
  this period. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with
  a responsible physician. In addition, female participants must not donate or retrieve
  for their own use, ova while on study and for 8 months following the last dose of
  study intervention.
