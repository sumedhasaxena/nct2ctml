summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of FB-1603 on
  improving liver function impairment in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving
  transarterial chemoembolization. The main question it aims to answer is:


  Changes in the level of liver function parameters, including AST, ALT, or total
  bilirubin, from baseline to Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6


  There is a comparison group: Researchers will compare arm 1 placebo to see if FB-1603
  is work to treat the liver function.


  Participants will


  1. Take drug FB-1603 990mg/day, FB-1603 1980mg/day or a placebo every day for 10
  weeks.

  2. Visit the clinic on day 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 56 and 84 (follow-up)'
