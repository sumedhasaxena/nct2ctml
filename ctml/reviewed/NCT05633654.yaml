summary: The goal of this study is to find out if the experimental product, sacituzumab
  govitecan-hziy (SG) in combination with pembrolizumab given after surgery, is effective
  and safe compared to the treatment of physician's choice (TPC) which includes either
  pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus capecitabine in participants with triple negative
  breast cancer that still remains after surgery and pre-surgical treatment.
