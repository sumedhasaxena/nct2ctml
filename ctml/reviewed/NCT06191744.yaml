summary: 'Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common B-cell cancer and the
  most common type of cancer of lymphocytes. Unfortunately, this disease is incurable
  with conventional treatment and the disease recurs in almost all patients. This
  study will assess how safe and effective epcoritamab is in combination with lenalidomide
  and rituximab (R2) in treating adult participants with previously untreated FL.
  Adverse events and change in disease condition will be assessed.


  Epcoritamab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of FL.
  Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 5 groups, called treatment arms. Each
  group receives a different treatment. Around 1095 adult participants with previously
  untreated FL will be enrolled in approximately 250 sites across the world.


  Participants will receive R2 (intravenous \[IV\] infusion of rituximab (R) and oral
  capsules of lenalidomide) alone or in combination with subcutaneous injections of
  epcoritamab. Participants may also receive investigator''s choice chemoimmunotherapy
  (CIT): IV infusion of obinutuzumab (G) and IV injections of cyclophosphamide, IV
  injections of doxorubicin, IV injections of vincristine, oral tablets of prednisone
  (CHOP) \[G-CHOP\]/ R-CHOP or G and IV infusion of bendamustine (Benda) \[G-Benda\]/R-Benda.
  The total treatment duration will be 120 weeks for all arms except A2, which is
  24 weeks of treatment.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical
  assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.'
