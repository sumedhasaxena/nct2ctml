summary: 'This is a first-in-human Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose,
  dose-escalation study of ABL103 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD (maximum
  tolerated dose) and/or RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose), pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity,
  preliminary antitumor activity of ABL103 in subjects with any progressive locally
  advanced(unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor who are relapsed or refractory
  following the last line of treatment and have no available standard of care option.
  This study includes 2 parts: a dose-escalation part and tumor-expansion part'

      arm_description: ABL103 will be administered biweekly of every 28-day cycle
        in the dose-escalation. The dosing interval to be used in tumor-expansion
        part will be evaluated based on the emerging safety and PK data from the dose-escalation
        part of the study.
