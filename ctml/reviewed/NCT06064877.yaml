prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Male or female and \u2265 18 years of age"
- '* Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed primary diagnosis of R/M HNSCC'
- '* Participants with oropharyngeal cancer will be required to have proof of p16
  negative status submitted on the basis of a pathology report'
- '* At least 1 measurable lesion by contrast CT or MRI scan according to RECIST v.1.1.
  Such lesions must not have been previously irradiated; if the measurable lesion(s)
  has been irradiated, clear progression must be documented'
- '* Participants must have failed prior therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICI and with
  platinum-based chemotherapy administered in combination or sequentially, in either
  the locally advanced or R/M setting. Failure of prior treatment may be due to progression
  of disease or intolerance to treatment'
- '* Patient''s tumor must be considered inoperable and incurable'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with a
  life expectancy of at least 12 weeks'
- '* For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), documentation of negative serum
  pregnancy test within 30 days of randomization'
- '* For WOCBP and male participants whose sexual partners are of childbearing potential,
  agreement to use an effective method of contraception during the study and for at
  least 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Birth control methods which
  may be considered highly effective include methods that achieve a failure rate of
  less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.'
- '* Ability to give written informed consent and comply with protocol requirements'
- '* Patients with feeding tubes are eligible for the study.'
- '* Archived tissue sample must be submitted to the Sponsor-designated laboratory
  within 60 days of randomization for c-Met analysis (if a tissue sample is not available,
  a fresh biopsy may be required prior to enrollment)'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Participants who have received \> 2 prior lines of anticancer therapy
  or prior treatment with cetuximab/alternative EGFR inhibitors for the treatment
  of R/M HNSCC
- Exclude - * History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity
  to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational agent or cetuximab
- 'Exclude - * Known or suspected untreated and uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal
  carcinomatosis Note: Participants with locally treated brain metastases are eligible
  provided 2 weeks have elapsed since local therapy. Participants are allowed to continue
  steroid taper during the start of study treatment.'
- 'Exclude - * Prior treatment with any other investigational drug or biologic agent
  or radiation therapy before a washout has been completed (must be completed prior
  to randomization):'
- Exclude - 1. 2 weeks (14 days) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for chemotherapeutic
  agents, small molecules, and checkpoint inhibitors
- Exclude - 2. 3 weeks (21 days) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for antibody-drug
  conjugates
- Exclude - 3. 4 weeks (28 days) for cell therapies
- Exclude - 4. 2 weeks (14 days) for radiation therapy
- Exclude - * Any unresolved and significant toxicity (National Cancer Institute Common
  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI-CTCAE\] version 5.0) Grade \> 2 from
  previous anticancer therapy (including radiation therapy), other than alopecia
- 'Exclude - * Significant cardiovascular disease, including: Cardiac failure New
  York Heart Association class III or IV; Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable
  angina within 6 months prior to randomization; History of serious ventricular arrhythmia
  (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)'
- Exclude - * Any other medical condition or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion
  of the Investigator, might interfere with the participant's involvement in the study
  or interfere with the interpretation of study results
- Exclude - * History of prior malignancy within 2 years prior to randomization (except
  for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast
  or cervix, superficial bladder cancer, or early-stage prostate cancer, without evidence
  of recurrence; participants may or may not be on maintenance therapy)
- Exclude - * Participants who are positive for HBV or HCV with indication of acute
  or chronic hepatitis (as defined in protocol)
- Exclude - * Radiographic evidence (historical or at screening) of interstitial lung
  disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Exclude - * Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Exclude - A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the protocol.

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ficlatuzumab
  plus cetuximab compared to placebo plus cetuximab in participants with recurrent/metastatic
  (R/M) HPV-negative Head and Neck Cancer.


  The primary hypothesis is that ficlatuzumab combined with cetuximab is superior
  to cetuximab alone in terms of progression-free survival and/or overall survival.'
