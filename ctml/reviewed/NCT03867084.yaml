summary: 'This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
  versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) and complete radiological response after surgical resection or local ablation.
  The primary hypotheses of this study are that adjuvant pembrolizumab is superior
  to placebo with respect to: 1) recurrence-free survival (RFS) as assessed by blinded
  independent central review (BICR); and 2) overall survival (OS).'
