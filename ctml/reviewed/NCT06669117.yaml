prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '1. Part 1: histological confirmation of relapsed and/or refractory locally advanced
  or metastatic solid tumor for which no standard of care treatment is available.'
- '2. Part 2: histological confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC Stage
  IIIB/C or IV (American Joint Commission on Cancer \[AJCC\] 8th edition) in participants
  who are not eligible for or should have received available standard of care therapies
  including curative intent surgery, chemoradiation, radiotherapy or systemic therapy.'
- '3. Part 1: presence of at least one of the following MET alterations based on local
  documentation of blood or archived tissue results:'
- '* METex14 mutation'
- '* MET kinase domain activating gene mutations (e.g. H1094L/R/Y, D1228H/N/V, Y1230A/C/D/H)'
- '* MET amplification'
- "4. Part 2-a: presence of METex14 mutation (based on local documentation of blood\
  \ or archived tissue results) and for Part 2-b presence of at least one of the following\
  \ MET alterations: METex14 mutation (based on local documentation of blood or archived\
  \ tissue results), de novo MET amplification (based on local documentation of archived\
  \ tissue results). Confirmation after enrollment in the trial will be performed\
  \ by central testing from an archival tumor biopsy sample (either tissue block or\
  \ at least 15 serial cut unstained slides of 5 \u03BCm, at least 20% tumor content).\
  \ In case no archival biopsy is available for central testing, the patient must\
  \ be willing to have a fresh tumor biopsy sample collected and the tumor biopsy\
  \ should be deemed safe and feasible by the investigator."
- '5. Part 2: at least one measurable target lesion according to RECIST v1.1.'
- 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.
- '7. Part 1: participants may have received MET Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) as
  part of previous treatment, regardless of the line of therapy (first or second line),
  and regardless of the MET TKI being combined or not. Note: crizotinib will be considered
  a MET TKI.'
- '8. Part 2: a maximum of 3 prior lines of systemic therapies.'
- 9. Adequate hematologic function.
- 10. Adequate hepatic function.
- 11. Adequate renal function.
- "12. Albumin \u2265 3 g/dL."
- 13. Adequate coagulation function.
- 14. Adequate cardiac function.
- "15. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive\
  \ serum \u03B2-HCG test performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of VERT-002\
  \ and a negative urine pregnancy test performed at C1D1 prior to the first dose\
  \ of VERT-002."
- 16. Male participants/partners with female spouse/partners of childbearing potential
  must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child.
- 'NOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion criteria may apply.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Part 2: Documented evidence by local testing of targetable oncogene
  driver mutations.'
- 'Exclude - 2. History of a primary malignancy other than the cancer under trial
  (as defined for Parts 1 and 2) with the exception of:'
- Exclude - * Participants with a previous malignancy who completed their anticancer
  treatment at least 2 years before signing informed consent and with no evidence
  of residual disease from the prior malignancy at screening.
- Exclude - * Malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (i.e. 5-year
  overall survival rate \> 90%) that are adequately treated.
- Exclude - 3. Uncontrolled Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases or spinal cord
  compression that are associated with progressive neurological symptoms or require
  increasing doses of corticosteroids to control the CNS disease.
- Exclude - 4. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive ingredients of VERT-002,
  or drugs with a similar chemical structure or from a similar class.
- Exclude - 5. Active, bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, within 2 weeks prior
  to the first dose of VERT-002 (C1D1).
- Exclude - 6. Positive SARs-CoV-2 or variants of SARs-CoV2 test within 2 weeks prior
  to first dose administration of VERT-002 (C1D1) or with suspected infection with
  SARs-CoV-2 or variants of SARs-CoV-2 and confirmation pending.
- Exclude - 7. Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular
  disease (either active or within 6 months prior to signing main informed consent).
- Exclude - 8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to psychiatric
  illness or social situation that would limit compliance with trial requirements.
- Exclude - 9. Past medical history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), drug induced
  ILD, radiation pneumonitis that requires steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically
  active ILD.
- Exclude - 10. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
- 'Exclude - 11. Prior anticancer therapy:'
- Exclude - * MET TKI within 7 days prior to the first dose of VERT-002,
- Exclude - * Any other systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives
  of the anticancer therapy whichever is the shortest, but with a minimum of 14 days
  interval, prior to the first dose of VERT-002 (C1D1),
- Exclude - * Radiotherapy to a large field or including a vital organ (including
  whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery to brain) within 14 days prior
  to the first dose of VERT-002 (C1D1).
- Exclude - 12. Live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of
  VERT-002 (C1D1).
- "Exclude - 13. Any toxicities from prior therapy with NCI- CTCAE Grade \\> 1 at\
  \ the time of the first dose administration of VERT-002 (C1D1). Exceptions include\
  \ any grade alopecia, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy with a grade \u2264 2."
- Exclude - 14. Major surgical procedure within 14 days of the first dose of VERT-002
  (C1D1).
