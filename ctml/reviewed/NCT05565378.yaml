summary: This study will monitor the safety of novel immunotherapy combinations in
  participants with Programmed death ligand-1 (PD L-1) high (Tumor cells \[TC\]/ Tumor
  proportion score \[TPS\] \>= 50%), previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced
  or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Drug name mentioned as Belrestotug,
  GSK4428859A, and EOS884448 are all interchangeable for the same compound. In the
  rest of the document, the drug will be referred to as Belrestotug.
