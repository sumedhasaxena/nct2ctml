summary: "Brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) is an immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptor\
  \ against cancer (ImmTAC \xAE) designed for the treatment of cancers positive for\
  \ the tumor-associated antigen PRAME. This is a first-in-human trial designed to\
  \ evaluate the safety and efficacy of brenetafusp in adult participants who have\
  \ the appropriate HLA-A2 tissue marker and whose cancer is positive for PRAME."
