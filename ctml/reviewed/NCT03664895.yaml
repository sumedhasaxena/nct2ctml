summary: "DELFINO tial is designed to investigate the role of \"OFS add on to TMX\
  \ \", based on MMG density as a surrogate marker in premenopausal women\n\n* Premise\
  \ - MMG density as a surrogate marker of hormone therapy\n* Assumption - \"Add on\
  \ OFS to TMX\" would have further decrease of density\n\n  * 3-arm(Observation arm\
  \ + Randomised 2-arm), phase III, RCT with 1:1 allocation"
