summary: 'Researchers want to learn if patritumab deruxtecan (MK-1022) can treat certain
  breast cancers. The breast cancers being studied are HER2 positive unresectable
  locally advanced or metastatic (the cancer has spread to other parts of the body).
  The goals of this study are to learn:


  * About the safety and how well people tolerate of patritumab deruxtecan

  * How many people have the cancer respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment'
