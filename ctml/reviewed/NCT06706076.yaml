summary: 'BH-30643-01 is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open label, dose escalation
  and expansion study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or human epidermal
  growth factor receptor (HER2) mutations. The study drug, BH-30643 capsules, will
  be self-administered by mouth twice daily in 21-day cycles.


  Phase 1 will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and, if applicable, the
  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BH-30643.


  Phase 2 will further evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety in specified cohorts
  determined by EGFR/HER2 mutation subtypes and/or treatment history at the RP2D,
  as well as the population PK.'
