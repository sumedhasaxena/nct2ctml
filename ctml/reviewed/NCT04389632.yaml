  unresectable solid malignancy within one of the tumor types listed below (dependent
  on study part).'

- '* Part A only: Participants must have disease that is relapsed or refractory or
  be intolerant to standard-of-care therapies and should have no appropriate standard-of-care
  therapeutic options.'

  be intolerant to standard-of-care therapies. Participants must have received platinum-based
  therapy and a PD-1/PD-(L)1 inhibitor, if applicable and available.'
- "* Part C only: For pembrolizumab combination cohorts, participants must be eligible\
  \ for pembrolizumab per local standard of care. For pembrolizumab with cisplatin\
  \ or carboplatin, participants must be eligible for both pembrolizumab and the platinum\
  \ agent per local standard of care. Participants must be treatment na\xEFve for\
  \ locally advanced or metastatic systemic therapy (prior definitively intended or\
  \ \\[neo\\]adjuvant therapy is allowed)."
- "* Part D only: Participants must be treatment na\xEFve for locally advanced or\

  biopsy is required. An archival biopsy collected within 90 days prior to first dose
  of study drug may be used.'

- Exclude - * History of another malignancy within 3 years before first dose of study
  drug, or any evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy.
  Exceptions are malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death.
- 'Exclude - * Known active central nervous system metastases. Participants with previously
  treated brain metastases may participate provided they:'
- Exclude - * are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry after
  brain metastasis treatment,
- Exclude - * have no new or enlarging brain metastases, and
- Exclude - * are off of corticosteroids prescribed for symptoms associated with brain
  metastases for at least 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - * In Part D, participants with untreated, asymptomatic CNS metastases
  smaller than 1 cm may be enrolled without definitive treatment as long as they have
  no neurological symptoms, no or minimal surrounding edema, and no requirements for
  corticosteroids.
- Exclude - * Carcinomatous meningitis
- Exclude - * Previous receipt of an MMAE-containing agent or an agent targeting integrin
  beta-6
- Exclude - * Pre-existing neuropathy Grade 1 or greater per the National Cancer Institute's

  Parts C and D cohorts with cisplatin or carboplatin; Grade 2 or greater per the
  NCI CTCAE v5.0 for all other cohorts
- Exclude - * Any uncontrolled Grade 3 or higher (per NCI CTCAE v5.0) viral, bacterial,
  or fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of sigvotatug vedotin.
- Exclude - * Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is permitted
- "Exclude - * Grade \u22653 pulmonary disease unrelated to underlying malignancy.\
  \ This includes clinically severe pulmonary function compromise resulting from clinically\
  \ significant pulmonary illnesses"
- 'Exclude - * Part C and D: Prior therapy with a PD-1 inhibitor, anti-PD-(L)1, or
  anti PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory
  T-cell receptor and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher
  immune-mediated adverse event (IMAE).'
- Exclude - * History of noninfectious interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis
  that required steroids, current ILD or pneumonitis, or suspected ILD or pneumonitis
  that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening
- Exclude - * Known diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; adjusted
  for hemoglobin) \<50% predicted
- Exclude - * Investigator site staff directly involved in the conduct of the study
  and their family members, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and
  sponsor and sponsor delegate employees directly involved in the conduct of the study

summary: "This trial will look at a drug called sigvotatug vedotin (SGN-B6A) alone\
  \ and with pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, to find out whether it is\
  \ safe for people who have solid tumors. It will study sigvotatug vedotin to find\
  \ out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides\
  \ treating cancer. It will also study whether sigvotatug vedotin works to treat\
  \ solid tumors.\n\nThe study will have four parts.\n\n* Part A of the study will\
  \ find out how much sigvotatug vedotin should be given to participants.\n* Part\
  \ B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe sigvotatug vedotin is\
  \ and if it works to treat solid tumors.\n* Part C of the study will find out how\
  \ safe sigvotatug vedotin is in combination with these other drugs.\n* Part D will\
  \ include people who have not received treatment. This part of the study will find\
  \ out how safe sigvotatug vedotin is in combination with these other drugs and if\
  \ these combinations work to treat solid tumors.\n* In Parts C and D, participants\
  \ will receive sigvotatug vedotin with either:\n\n  * Pembrolizumab or,\n  * Pembrolizumab\
  \ and carboplatin, or\n  * Pembrolizumab and cisplatin."
