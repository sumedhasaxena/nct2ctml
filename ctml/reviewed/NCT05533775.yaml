  treatment period and within 12 months after end of study treatment
- Exclude - * Participants with any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
  examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glofitamab,
  as monotherapy and in combination with a standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen: rituximab,
  ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE) in pediatric and young adult participants
  with relapsed and refractory (R/R) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).'
