  Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) of non-squamous (NSQ) histology with no prior systemic
  anti-cancer therapy given as primary therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.'
- "* Participants must have measurable PD-L1 \u2265 1% Tumor Cell (TC) score by the\
  \ investigational PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) CDx\
  \ Assay conducted by central laboratory during the screening period prior to randomization."
- '* Participants must have measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST v1.1 criteria.'
- "* Participants must have an Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\
  \ status of \u2264 1 at screening."

  lymphoma kinase (ALK), or ROS-1 mutations that are sensitive to available targeted
  inhibitor therapy. Participants with unknown EGFR, ALK, or ROS-1 status are excluded.
- Exclude - * Participants with known BRAFV600E mutations, that are sensitive to available
  targeted inhibitor therapy; participants with known activating rearranged during

  meningitis).
- Exclude - * Participants must not have concurrent malignancy requiring treatment.
- Exclude - * Participants must not have an active autoimmune disease.
- Exclude - * Participants must not have history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis
  that required oral or intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids to assist with management.
- Exclude - * Participants must not have a history of myocarditis.
- Exclude - * Participants must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
  anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or other antibody or drug targeting T-cell
  co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.
- Exclude - * Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.
