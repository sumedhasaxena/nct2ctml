summary: 'This is a phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label umbrella platform study that
  will evaluate the safety and tolerability of sacituzumab tirumotecan with pembrolizumab
  and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for the first-line (1L) treatment of participants
  with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2 (HER2)-negative gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma.


  This substudy will have two phases: a safety lead-in phase and an efficacy phase.
  The safety lead-in phase will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and
  to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for sacituzumab tirumotecan in combination
  with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. There is no formal hypothesis in this study.'
