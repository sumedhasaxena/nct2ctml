summary: 'Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce
  uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change
  in disease activity when ABBV-400 is given in combination with Fluorouracil, Folinic
  Acid, and Bevacizumab to adult participants to treat unresctable metastatic colorectal
  cancer.


  ABBV-400 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of unresectable
  metastatic colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil, folinic acid, and bevacizumab (FFB)
  is an approved drug for the treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
  Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. Each treatment
  arm receives a different dose of ABBV-400 in combination with FFB in escalating
  doses on two different schedules (safety lead in), followed by low or high doses
  of ABBV-400 in combination with FFB or fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and
  bevacizumab (standard of care \[SOC\]) \[dose optimization\] on its own, ending
  with low or high doses of ABBV-400 in combination with FFB for continued dose optimization
  and expansion. Approximately 280 adult participants with unresectable metastatic
  colorectal cancer will be enrolled in the study in 65 sites worldwide.


  In the safety lead in, participants will receive escalating intravenous (IV) ABBV-400
  in combination with IV FFB on two different schedules. During the dose optimization
  participants will receive IV ABBV-400 in combination with IV FFB at low or high
  doses determined in the safety lead in. The dose optimization arm will also include
  a comparator cohort in which participants will receive SOC. During the dose optimization
  and expansion stage, participants will receive IV ABBV-400 in combination with IV
  FFB at low or high doses that have been determined from the previous stages. The
  study will run for a duration of approximately 3 years.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
