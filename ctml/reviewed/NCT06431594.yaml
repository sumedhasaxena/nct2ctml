- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Males or females aged 18 years or older (\u226518 years)."
- '* Participants with pathologically confirmed advanced solid tumor (who have failed
  or are intolerant to standard of care).'
- '* PROC cohort'
- 1. Histologically documented, advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) high-grade
  serous/endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
- 2. Must have received or are intolerant to 1 but no more than 3 lines of prior systemic
  therapy.
- 3. Platinum-resistant disease, defined as progression or relapse within 6 months
  after the completion of platinum-based therapy.
- 4. Must have had prior bevacizumab if the participant was considered a candidate
  for this regimen and the regimen is locally available.
- "5. Participants with known Folate receptor-\u03B1 (FR-\u03B1) expressing tumors\
  \ must have received mirvetuximab soravtasine if the participants was considered\
  \ a candidate for this regimen and the regimen is locally available."
- 6. Participants with known Breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated tumors
  should have received a Poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
  if the participant was considered a candidate for this regimen and the regimen is
  locally available.
- '* Endometrial cancer cohort'
- 1. Histologically documented, advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) or recurrent
  endometrial cancer.
- 2. Must have received or are intolerant to 1 but no more than 3 lines of prior systemic
  therapy.
- 3. Must have had prior platinum and PD(L)-1 inhibitor (in same regimen or in separate
  regimens), if considered a candidate for this regimen and the regimen is locally
  available.
- 4. All epithelial histologies are permitted including carcinosarcoma.
- '* Participants have at least one target lesion as assessed per the RECIST 1.1'
- '* Tumor tissue from a newly obtained biopsy or archival tumor tissue is required
  for retrospective detection of B7 homolog 4 (B7-H4) expression by Immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) in central laboratory and other biomarker analysis. Tissue from a newly obtained
  biopsy is preferred. If a newly obtained biopsy is not feasible, archival tumor
  tissue within 2 years prior to the first dose of study drug is acceptable.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score of 0 to
  2 and no deterioration within 2 weeks before the first dose.'

- Exclude - * Have received any of B7-H4-targeted therapies.
- Exclude - * Have received any of cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, anti-tumor traditional
  Chinese medicines or other anti-tumor drugs within 28 days prior to the first dose
  of study drug; or need to continue these drugs during the study.
- Exclude - * Have received locoregional radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to
  the first dose of study drug; more than 30% of bone marrow irradiation or wide-field
  radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Presence of pleural/abdominal effusion/ascites requiring clinical intervention;
  presence of pericardial effusion
- Exclude - * Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Evidence of brain metastasis unless asymptomatic.
- Exclude - * Has inadequate bone marrow reserve or hepatic/renal functions.
- Exclude - * Mean Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) \> 470 millisecond (msec)

- Exclude - * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \< 50%.
- Exclude - * Have severe, uncontrolled or active cardiovascular disorders, serious
  or poorly controlled hypertension, clinically significant bleeding symptoms or serious
  arteriovenous thromboembolic events
- Exclude - * Any evidence of current Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis
  or a prior history of ILD or pneumonitis requiring high-dose systemic glucocorticoids.
- Exclude - * Have received prior therapy with topoisomerase inhibitors or topoisomerase
  inhibitor Antibody-drug conjugate (ADCs)
- Exclude - * PROC
- Exclude - 1. Primary platinum refractory disease defined as those who have progressed
  on or within 12 weeks of last dose of first line platinum therapy not permitted.
- Exclude - 2. Non-epithelial carcinoma, clear-cell, mucinous, germ-cell, low-grade
  serous, or low-grade endometrioid carcinoma not permitted.
