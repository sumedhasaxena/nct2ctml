summary: The goal of this study is to evaluate intismeran autogene plus pembrolizumab
  versus placebo plus pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of margin negative,
  completely resected Stage II, IIIA, IIIB (with nodal involvement \[N2\]) non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypothesis is that intismeran autogene plus
  pembrolizumab is superior to placebo plus pembrolizumab with respect to disease-free
  survival (DFS) as assessed by the investigator.
