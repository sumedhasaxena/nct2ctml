prior_treatment_requirements:
- Key Inclusion criteria
- "* Participants must be adults \u2265 18 years of age with signed informed consent\
  \ prior to participation to study"
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer'
- '* Participants must have ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist/antagonist
  or prior bilateral orchiectomy at the time of randomization. Intermittent administration
  of ADT is accepted before randomization if criterion for serum testosterone is met'
- '* Castrate level of serum testosterone (\< 1.7 nmol/l \[50 ng/dl\]) on GnRH agonist
  or antagonist therapy (continuous/intermittent) or after bilateral orchiectomy prior
  to randomization'
- '* Participants must have evidence of PSMA-positive disease (N1 or M1) as seen on
  a AAA517 or piflufolastat F 18 PET/CT scan at baseline as determined by Blinded
  Independent Central Review (BICR) based on the methodology proposed in the Prostate
  Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation (PROMISE) (Eiber et al 2018). Participants
  with M1 disease only on PSMA PET scan are allowed to participate'
- '* Participants must have a negative conventional imaging for M1 disease.'
- '* Participants must have adequate organ functions: bone marrow reserve, hepatic
  \& renal'
- Key Exclusion criteria
- '* Prior or present evidence of metastatic disease as assessed by CT/MRI locally
  for soft tissue disease and whole-body radionuclide bone scan for bone disease.
  Exception: Participants with pelvic disease may be eligible (e.g., participants
  with enlarged lymph nodes below the bifurcation of common iliac arteries (N1))'
- '* Unmanageable concurrent bladder outflow obstruction or urinary incontinence.
  Note: participants with bladder outflow obstruction or urinary incontinence, which
  is manageable with best available standard of care (incl. pads, drainage) are allowed'
- '* Active clinically significant cardiac disease; history of seizure or condition
  that may pre-dispose to seizure which may require treatment with surgery or radiation
  therapy'
- "* Prior therapy with: second generation anti-androgens (e.g., enzalutamide, apalutamide\
  \ and darolutamide) \\< 3 months before randomization; CYP17 inhibitors (e.g., abiraterone\
  \ acetate, orteronel, galeterone) \\< 3 months before randomization; ketoconazole\
  \ (short duration ketoconazole treatment (\\<28 days) is permitted); radiopharmaceutical\
  \ agents (e.g., Strontium-89) if wash-out period of at least 3 months is not completed,\
  \ PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy; immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucel-T); chemotherapy,\
  \ except if administered in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, completed \\> 2 years\
  \ before randomization; any other investigational agents for CRPC; use of estrogens,\
  \ 5-\u03B1 reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), other steroidogenesis\
  \ inhibitors (aminoglutethimide) or first-generation anti-androgens (bicalutamide,\
  \ flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone) within 28 days before randomization; radiation\
  \ therapy (external beam radiation therapy \\[EBRT\\] and brachytherapy within 28\
  \ days before randomization"
- '* Other concurrent cytotoxicity chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radioligand therapy,
  poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, biological therapy
  or investigational therapy'
- Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AAA617
  alone (Lutetium \[177Lu\] vipivotide tetraxetan) and in combination with an Androgen
  Receptor Pathway Inhibitors (ARPI) in participants with PSMA-positive, castration-resistant
  prostate cancer and no evidence of metastasis in conventional imaging (CI) (i.e.,
  CT/MRI and bone scans). Approximately 80 participants will be randomized.
