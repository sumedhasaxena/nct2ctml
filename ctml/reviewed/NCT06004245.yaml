summary: This is a first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation
  and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
  pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of VVD-133214 monotherapy,
  and in combination with pembrolizumab, in participants with microsatellite instability
  (MSI) and/or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) advanced solid tumors. VVD-133214
  is an oral drug that acts on a protein called Werner (WRN), which may promote the
  growth of cancers that are MSI and/or dMMR. By acting on WRN, VVD-133214 may be
  able to block the growth of these types of cancer.
