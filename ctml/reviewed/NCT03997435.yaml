prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Able to provide written informed consent'
- '* Age \>= 18 years of either sex.'
- '* ECOG performance status 0-1'
- '* Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.'
- '* Histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma (defined as either mid- or low
  rectal cancer that is located within 12 cm from the anal verge OR below the peritoneal
  reflection) that is previously untreated.'
- '* ''High risk'' rectal cancer, or rectal cancers that are considered marginally
  perable where there is a significant risk of positive surgical margin:'
- '* T3 or T4, and / or'
- '* Tumour infiltrating perirectal fat and/ or mesorectal fascia, and / or Involvement
  of pelvic lymph nodes, and/or'
- '* Tumour invading surrounding structures or peritoneum or vasculature.'
- '* Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as defined by: absolute neutrophil
  count \>= 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin \>= 9 g/L, platelets \>= 100 x 109/L, serum creatinine
  level \< 1.5 x ULN (or calculated creatinine clearance \>=50 ml/min, whichever is
  worse), total bilirubin \<=1.5 x the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase
  (ALT) \< 3 upper limit of normal.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Known distant metastasis, even if the metastasis has been resected.
- Exclude - * History of another invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, except
  for treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
  or breast DCIS.
- Exclude - * Upper rectal cancer that is located above the peritoneal reflection.
- 'Exclude - * Patients with synchronous colon and rectal cancers are not excluded
  as long as: (1) these tumors are considered as two separate primaries (i.e. not
  metastasis or a contiguous part of a large primary), (2) both tumors are not causing
  imminent obstruction; (3) pelvic radiotherapy is not considered a contraindication.'
- Exclude - * Primary tumour associated with any one of the following features:Frank
  intestinal obstruction, or
- 'Exclude - * Endoscope unable to pass through the tumour''s lumen plus worsening
  local obstructive symptoms. Note: Patients with such features should be assessed
  by the surgical team regarding stomal bypass prior to study enrolment. Such patients
  can still be considered for study enrolment after undergoing stomal bypass.'
- Exclude - * Known hypersensitivity reaction to the study drugs (i.e. fluoropyrimidine,
  irinotecan, oxaliplatin)
- Exclude - * Known peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or more in severity.\\ -Patients
  who have received an experimental anticancer therapy within the last 28 days.
- Exclude - * Previous pelvic radiotherapy
- Exclude - * Previous oxaliplatin or irinotecan for the treatment of colon or rectal
  cancer.
- Exclude - * Patient with hip prosthesis
- 'Exclude - * Major surgery (i.e. requiring general anaesthetics) within the last
  28 days. Exception: Any patient who underwent stomal bypass for obstructing primary
  tumour within the last 14 days are still eligible, as long as the patient has sufficiently
  recovered from the surgery at the investigator''s discretion.'
- Exclude - * Known cardiac disease that is symptomatic or poorly controlled, including
  cardiac failure, arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease.
- Exclude - * Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the last 12
  months.
- Exclude - * Intercurrent infections or medical illnesses that are serious/ potentially
  life-threatening and require ongoing treatment.
- Exclude - * Patients who are unable to take capecitabine tablets uncrushed by the
  oral route (e.g. enteral feeding). Patients with significantly impaired gastrointestinal
  integrity and absorption are excluded.
- 'Exclude - * Patients with known and untreated bilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters
  (or unilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters in any patient with a single kidney)
  are excluded. The obstruction should be treated with ureteric stent(s) or percutaneous
  nephrostomy(s) prior to study enrolment. Patients with unilateral hydronephrosis
  and/or hydroureters and adequate renal function (i.e. as stated in the eligibility
  criteria: serum creatinine level \< 1.5 x ULN, or calculated creatinine clearance
  \>=50 ml/min - whichever is worse) are not excluded.'
- Exclude - * Patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on low molecular weight heparin
  are not excluded.
- Exclude - * Pregnant or lactating women.
- Exclude - * Patients with reproductive potential who are not willing to use barrier
  method of birth control.
- Exclude - * Patients who are unable to provide written informed consent, or to comply
  with study requirements as judged by the investigator.
- Exclude - * Patients who refuse surgical treatment of the rectal cancer.
