  and/or urine)

  \ ratio"
- 4. Participant has documented relapsed or progressive MM on or after any regimen
  or who are refractory to the most recent line of therapy.
- i. Relapsed MM is defined as previously treated MM that progresses and requires
  initiation of salvage therapy but does not meet the criteria for refractory MM.
- ii. Refractory MM is defined as disease that is nonresponsive (failure to achieve
  minimal response or development of progressive disease) while on primary or salvage
  therapy or progresses within 60 days of last therapy.
- "1. In Part 1 and Part 2 Cohorts 1 and 2 participants should have relapsed or progressive\
  \ disease and have had \u2265 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor,\
  \ an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and no more available approved\
  \ therapies."
- "2. Participants in Part 2 Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 should have relapsed or progressive\
  \ disease and have had \u2265 1 prior line of therapy. Prior treatment with carfilzomib\
  \ is allowed but the patient must not be considered carfilzomib refractory by the\
  \ investigator."
- 3. Participants in Part 2 Cohorts 6 and 7 should have relapsed or progressive disease
  and have had 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and previously treated with a proteasome
  inhibitor and an IMiD
- 5. Positivity for t(11;14) translocation must be confirmed by validated fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (FISH) testing assay in a pre-defined laboratory
- a. fresh bone marrow aspirate sample must be collected at screening and sent to
  central laboratory for t(11;14) FISH testing.
- '6. Adequate organ function defined as:'
- "1. Hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL within 7 days before first dose of study treatment,\
  \ (transfusions, in accordance with institutional guidelines, are permitted)"
- "2. Platelet count \u2265 75,000/\u03BCL, within 7 days before first dose of study\
  \ treatment, independent of growth factor support and transfusions"
- "3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1000/mm\\^3 within 7 days before first\
  \ dose of study treatment"

  \ x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin \u2264 2.0 x ULN N (total bilirubin\
  \ must be \\< 3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert's syndrome)"
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Participant has any of the following conditions:'
- Exclude - 1. Non secretory MM (Serum free light chains \< 10 mg/dL)
- Exclude - 2. Solitary plasmacytoma
- Exclude - 3. Active plasma cell leukemia (ie, either 20% of peripheral white blood
  cells or \> 2.0 x 109/L circulating plasma cells by standard differential)

- "Exclude - 1. Myocardial infarction \u2264 6 months before screening"
- "Exclude - 2. Ejection fraction \u2264 50%"
- "Exclude - 3. Unstable angina\u2264 3 months before screening"
- Exclude - 4. New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure
- Exclude - 5. History of clinically significant arrhythmias (eg, sustained ventricular
  tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes)
- Exclude - 6. Heart rate-corrected QT interval \> 480 milliseconds based on Fridericia's
  formula
- Exclude - 7. History of Mobitz II second-degree or third-degree heart block without
  a permanent pacemaker in place
- "Exclude - 8. Uncontrolled hypertension at screening, defined as systolic blood\
  \ pressure \\> 170 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \\> 105 mmHg by \u2265 2 consecutive\
  \ measurements. Prior therapy with sonrotoclax or other agents inhibiting BCL2 activity\
  \ (eg, venetoclax)"
- Exclude - 3. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
- 'Exclude - 4. Serologic status reflecting active viral hepatitis B (HBV) or viral
  hepatitis C (HCV) infection as follows:'
- Exclude - 1. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core
  antibody (HBcAb). Participants with presence of HBcAb, but absence of HBsAg, are
  eligible if HBV DNA is undetectable (limitation of sensitivity \< 20 IU/mL) ,),
  and if they are willing to undergo monthly monitoring for HBV reactivation.
- Exclude - 2. Presence of HCV antibody. Participants with presence of HCV antibody
  are eligible if HCV RNA is undetectable (limitation of sensitivity \< 15 IU/mL).
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
  of sonrotoclax as monotherapy and in various combinations in patients with relapsed/refractory
  (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) and chromosomal translocation t(11;14).


  The study investigates sonrotoclax alone and in combination with dexamethasone and
