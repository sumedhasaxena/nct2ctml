summary: "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat children with different types\
  \ of melanoma (skin cancer), solid tumors, and lymphomas (blood cancers) that are\
  \ any of these:\n\n* Advanced, which means cancer spread in the body or cannot be\
  \ removed with surgery\n* Relapsed, which means cancer has come back after it had\
  \ responded to previous treatment (responded means it stopped growing, gets smaller,\
  \ or disappeared)\n* Refractory, which means cancer did not respond to previous\
  \ treatment\n\nPembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps\
  \ the immune system fight cancer. Researchers want to learn if different doses of\
  \ pembrolizumab can cause at least 1 of the types of cancer to get smaller or go\
  \ away.\n\nWith Amendment 8, enrolment of participants with solid tumours and participants\
  \ 6 months to under 12 years old with melanoma were closed. Enrolment of participants\
  \ 12-18 years old with melanoma continues. Enrolment of participants who have tumours\
  \ with specific traits (microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H), and tumour-mutational\
  \ burden-high \u226510 mutation/Mb (TMB-H)) also continues."
