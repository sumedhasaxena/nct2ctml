summary: 'Substudy 03C is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental
  treatments for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The larger study is the umbrella study
  (U03).


  The goal of substudy 03C is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental
  combinations of investigational agents in participants with clear cell renal cell
  carcinoma (ccRCC) who have recurrent disease during or after anti-programmed cell
  death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-\[L\]1) adjuvant therapy.


  This substudy will have two phases: a safety lead-in phase and an efficacy phase.
  The safety lead-in phase will be used to demonstrate a tolerable safety profile
  for the combination of investigational agents. There will be no hypothesis testing
  in this study'
