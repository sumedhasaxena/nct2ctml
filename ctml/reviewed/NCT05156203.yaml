  plans, laboratory tests and other procedures.

- Exclude - 1. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
- 'Exclude - 2. Subjects receiving any of the following anti-cancer therapy:'
- Exclude - 1. Anti-cancer definitive radiation therapy (4,000-6,000 cGy) within 4
  weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
- "Exclude - 2. Palliative radiation (\u2264 10 fractions with total dose \\< 3,000\
  \ cGy) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug."
- Exclude - 3. Any systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first
  dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 4. Any targeted therapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
  prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 5. Any immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 3. Any interventional treatments in another clinical trial following Exclusion
  Criteria 2c, 2d and 2e.
- Exclude - 4. Subjects received blood transfusion or biological response modifiers
  (e.g., G-CSF) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 5. Subject who received autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cells
  rescue within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Exclude - 6. Subjects received strong inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4 within
  14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. A list of CYP3A4 modulators is provided
  in Appendix 3.
- Exclude - 7. Documented or suspected brain metastases, spinal cord compression,
  carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease.
- 'Exclude - 8. Any of the following within 6 months of the first dose of study drug:
  myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass
  graft, congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient
  ischemic attack.'
- "Exclude - 9. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of \u2265 NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grade\
  \ 2, or atrial fibrillation of any grade. Corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF)\
  \ \u2265 470 msec."
- Exclude - 10. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (\> 160/100
  mm-Hg despite optimal medical therapy).
- Exclude - 11. AIDS-defining opportunistic infections within the past 12 months.
- Exclude - 12. Positive test for hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (anti-HCV (anti-hepatitis
  C virus) antibody), unless the HCV RNA level is below the limit of detection (for
  subjects with positive anti-HCV Ab).
- Exclude - 13. Men and women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use highly
  effective contraceptive methods during the study period.
- Exclude - Highly effective contraceptive methods include implants, injectables,
  combined oral contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, surgical
  sterilization or a partner who is sterile.
- Exclude - 14. If females, patient is pregnant or breast feeding.
- Exclude - 15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
  laboratory abnormality that would impart, in the judgement of the investigator and/or
  sponsor, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration.

summary: 'T-1301 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases being developed
  as an oral drug for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The nonclinical study
  results demonstrate the nonclinical efficacy and safety of T-1301 and support the
  design of this Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial in subjects with advanced
  cancer.


  This study is an open-label, multi-center, Phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate
  the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of T-1301 capsules in subjects with
  advanced solid tumors (including lymphoma), and to identify the maximum tolerated
  dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Approximately 30 patients will
  be enrolled for the dose-escalation phase. Actual number of patients will be determined
  by the number of dose cohorts until the MTD is reached.


  T-1301 will be administered orally QD or BID in a 28-day cycle (21 days on treatment
  followed by 7 days off treatment) in sequential cohorts. Subjects can continue with
  the treatment until one of the discontinuation criteria is met or until the planned
  stop of the study (12 months after the last subject receives the first dose of study
  drug), whichever comes first.


  The planned dose levels are: 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 mg/day. The
  dosing schedule will be once daily (QD) at the first dose level (10 mg/day) and
  be changed to twice daily (BID) starting with the second dose level. Other dose
  levels or dosing frequency may be explored based on safety and related drug exposure
  data following the decision of Safety Review Committee.


  The dose escalation will follow accelerated titration and the Bayesian optimal interval
  (BOIN) design. During the initial accelerated titration phase, one (1) subject is
  enrolled per dose level. In the subsequent phase when the BOIN design is used, subjects
  will be enrolled in cohorts of size 3-6.'
