- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'The main inclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:'
- '* Has a diagnosis of hormone receptor positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor
  receptor 2 (HER2)- invasive breast carcinoma that is either locally advanced disease
  not amenable to resection with curative intent (herein called unresectable) or metastatic
  disease not treatable with curative intent'
- '* Has centrally-confirmed HR+ and HER2- results and human epidermal growth factor
  receptor 3 (HER3) evaluable results from a biopsy obtained from a distant metastatic
  site or a locally advanced lesion on or after the most recent line of therapy (with
  certain exceptions)'
- '* Must have had progression or recurrence on prior cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6
  inhibitor + endocrine therapy (ET) with one of the following:'
- '* Radiographic disease progression, as assessed by the investigator, on CDK4/6
  inhibitor + ET as 1L for treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
  HR+/HER2- breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitor + ET must be the only line of therapy
  received in the advanced setting, or'
- '* Disease recurrence, either radiographic and/or confirmed histologically via biopsy
  as assessed by the investigator, while on adjuvant ET in combination with a CDK4/6
  inhibitor OR within 24 months from the date of last dose of adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitor'
- '* Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the local site investigator/radiology'

  HIV on antiretroviral therapy'

  within 7 days before randomization'

  topoisomerase I inhibitor therapy
- Exclude - * Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy within 4 weeks (or 5
  half-lives, whichever is shorter) before randomization; participants previously
  treated with ET plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor may participate as long as at least 2 weeks

summary: 'Researchers are looking for other ways to treat breast cancer (BC) that
  is hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative
  (HR+/HER2-) and either unresectable locally advanced or metastatic.


  * HR positive (HR+) means the cancer cells have proteins that attach to estrogen
  or progesterone (hormones) which help the cancer to grow and spread

  * HER2 negative (HER2-) means the cancer cells have a low amount of a protein called
  HER2

  * Unresectable locally advanced means the cancer cannot be completely removed by
  surgery and has spread into nearby tissue or muscles

  * Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body


  Treatment for this type of breast cancer usually includes endocrine therapy (ET)
  and sometimes a second treatment. The main goal of this study is to learn if people
  who receive patritumab deruxtecan (also known as HER3-DXd and MK-1022) live longer
  overall or without the cancer growing/spreading, compared to people who receive
  chemotherapy or a different drug called trastuzumab deruxtecan.'
