prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Parts 1-3:'
- '* Muscle-invasive or recurrent, non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the
  bladder'
- '* For selected Cohorts: Activating tumor pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor
  (FGFR) mutation or fusion, as determined by local or central testing, approved by
  the sponsor prior to the start of study treatment. Local tissue-based results (if
  already existing) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) or polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR) tests performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -certified
  or equivalent laboratories, or results from commercially available PCR or NGS tests'
- "* Cohorts 1 and 2: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) experienced, or participants\
  \ with no BCG experience because BCG was not available as a treatment option in\
  \ the participant's location within the previous 2 years and is currently unavailable.\
  \ Participants who received an abbreviated course of BCG due to toxicity are still\
  \ eligible"
- '* Cohort 1 only: Refuses or is not eligible for radical cystectomy (RC)'
- '* Cohorts 2 and 4: Willing and eligible for RC'
- 'Part 4:'
- '* Have histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent Intermediate-risk-non-muscle
  invasive bladder cancer (IR-NMIBC) Ta LG tumors'
- '* Must not have undergone tumor debulking or selective ablation of visible lesions;
  partial tumor biopsy to confirm diagnosis and provide tissue for biomarker testing
  is permitted as long as remaining tumor is at least 5 millimeter (mm) in size'
- '* Must submit tissue and urine for FGFR testing'
- '* Can have a prior or concurrent second malignancy which natural history or treatment
  is unlikely to interfere with any study endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the
  study treatment'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Parts 1-3:'
- Exclude - * Concurrent extra-vesical (that is, urethra, ureter, renal pelvis) transitional
  cell carcinoma of the urothelium
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with an pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
  inhibitor
- Exclude - * Received pelvic radiotherapy \<=6 months prior to the planned start
  of study treatment. If received pelvic radiotherapy greater than (\>)6 months prior
  to the start of study treatment, there must be no cystoscopic evidence of radiation
  cystitis
- Exclude - * Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature that in the opinion
  of the investigator may prevent the safe use of Erdafitinib intravesical delivery
  system
- Exclude - * Indwelling urinary catheter. Intermittent catheterization is acceptable
- 'Exclude - Part 4:'
- Exclude - * Histologically confirmed diagnosis of T1 NMIBC, HR NMIBC (HG/G2 or HG/G3
  or CIS) or MIBC, locally advanced, non-resectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma
  at any time prior to enrollment
- Exclude - * Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any study component
  or its excipients
- Exclude - * Has a current diagnosis of primary IR-NMIBC
- Exclude - * Received an investigational treatment for bladder cancer after Transurethral
  Resection of the Bladder Tumor (TURBT) for the current NMIBC diagnosis or within
  4 weeks or the agent/therapy washout period, whichever is longer, before the planned
  first dose of study treatment, or is currently enrolled in an investigational study
- Exclude - * Evidence of current bladder perforation by cystoscopy or imaging

summary: The purpose of the study in Part 1 (dose escalation) and in Part 2 (dose
  expansion) is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D\[s\]) and evaluate
  preliminary clinical efficacy. Part 3 (dose expansion) will confirm safety and preliminary
  clinical activity at the RP2D. Part 4 (RP2D expansion) will assess the overall complete
  response (CR) in participants with intermediate-risk-non-muscle invasive bladder
  cancer (IR-NMIBC; means the cancer cells are only in the bladder's inner lining).
