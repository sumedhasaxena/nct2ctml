summary: The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of volrustomig
  compared to observation in participants with unresected locally advanced head and
  neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) who have not progressed after receiving
  definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT).
