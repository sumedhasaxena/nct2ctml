- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Adults \u226519 years old."
- 2. Pathologically documented breast cancer that is unresectable or metastatic
- 3. Tumor with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) defined by
- '* Germline or Somatic BRCA1/2 mutation'

- 4. Previously treated with a taxane, unless this treatment was contraindicated (whether
  in recurrent/metastatic setting or in neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting).
- 5. Previous treatment with platinum therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting
  is permitted, provided the patient did not have a progression during the platinum
  treatment. If the patient was treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum therapy,
  at least 6 months of disease-free interval is required after the last dose.
- 6. Documented radiologic progression (during or after most recent treatment or within
  6 months after completing adjuvant therapy).
- \- If the patients had relapsed within 6 months after adjuvant therapy, this will
  be counted as a systemic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease.
- 7. At least 3 weeks has passed since last chemotherapy treatment
- 8. At least 2 weeks has passed since last hormone therapy or radiation therapy (including
  palliative radiation).
- 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, or 1
- 10. At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by
  computed tomography (CT) (magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\] where CT is not feasible)
  and is suitable for repeated assessment as per RECIST v.1.1.
- 11. Male and female subjects of reproductive/childbearing potential must agree to
  use a highly effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse during and upon
  completion of the study and for at least 7.0 months after the last dose of study
  treatment.
- \- This study recommend "Copper T intrauterine device" as a highly effective methods
  of contraception (\<1% failure rate)
- 12. Adequate normal organ and marrow function measured within 28 days prior to administration
  of study treatment
- "* Hemoglobin \u22659.0 g/dL"
- "* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L"
- "* Platelet count \u2265 75 x 109/L"
- "* Serum bilirubin \u2264 2.0mg/dL \\[This will not apply to patients with confirmed\
  \ Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly\
  \ unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed\
  \ only in consultation with their physician.\\]"
- "* AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) \u22642.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless\
  \ liver metastases are present, in which case it must be \u22645x ULN"
- "* Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine \u22641.5mg/dL or estimated creatinine\
  \ clearance \\>60 mL/min"
- 13. Negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration in premenopausal
  patients.
- 14. Ability to understand and comply with protocol during study period
- 15. Patients should sign a written informed consent before study entry
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Prior treatment PARP inhibitor
- Exclude - 2. However, if the patient participated in a clinical trial evaluating
  adjuvant PARP inhibitor, patient is allowed to be included in the present study
  if the patient recurred 6 months after completing PARP inhibitor. No more than three
  line of previous systemic chemotherapy, excluding neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy.
  (No limitation on hormone therapy. Hormone therapy is not counted as previous line)
- Exclude - 3. If there is a standard treatment available for metastatic breast cancer.
- Exclude - 4. History of another primary malignancy except for
- "Exclude - * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease\
  \ \u22653 years"
- Exclude - * contralateral breast cancer
- Exclude - * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo malignancy without
  evidence of disease
- Exclude - * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease
- Exclude - 5. Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral
  medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical
  procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease,
  ulcerative colitis)
- Exclude - 6. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
- Exclude - 7. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression.
- Exclude - \- Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to
  confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive
  a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were
  started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression
  unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of
  clinically stable disease for 28 days
- Exclude - 8. active infection or immunocompromised patients including tuberculosis
  (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic
  findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B , hepatitis C,
  or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).
- Exclude - \- Subjects with simple HBV carrier, a past or resolved HBV infection
  (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \[anti-HBc\] and absence of
  HBsAg) are eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible
  only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.
- Exclude - 9. Patients who have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction
  or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to any of the study agents or their
  excipients.
- Exclude - 10. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
- Exclude - 11. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate
  in the study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions
  and requirements.

summary: Talazoparib has shown clinical efficacy in breast cancer patients with germline
  BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, it is plausible that
  talazoparib may have activity in patients with homologous recombination defects
  (HRD).
