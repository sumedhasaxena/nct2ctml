  \ MRI or ultrasound), with liver function at Child-Pugh score\\[1\\] \u2266 8."
- 4. Disease can be treated by trans-arterial chemoembolization, and can be evaluated
  by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT).

- '7. May have received local therapy such as TAE, TACE, radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
  or surgery and remain eligible for study provided the prior therapy was within the
  following timeframes and the subject has fully recovered from prior therapy:'
- 'A. TAE/TACE: more than 8 weeks since completion of prior therapy B. RFA: After
  PI confirm subject is fully recovered from prior therapy based on screening visit
  physical examination and liver function laboratory tests results.'
- 'C. Surgery: After PI confirm subject is fully recovered from prior therapy based
  on screening visit physical examination and liver function laboratory tests results.'

  trial practices.
- 9. Willing to sign a written informed consent form.

  that prolong the QT/QTc interval (e.g., class Ia, Ic or III antiarrhythmic drugs,
  tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines)
