summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy
  of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants from previous Merck pembrolizumab-based
  parent studies who transition into this extension study.


  This study will consist of three phases: 1) First Course Phase, 2) Survival Follow-up
  Phase or 3) Second Course Phase. Each participant will transition to this extension
  study in one of the following three phases, depending on the study phase they were
  in at the completion of the parent study. Participants who were in the First Course
  Phase of study treatment with pembrolizumab or lenvatinib in their parent study
  will enter the First Course Phase of this study and complete up to 35 doses or more
  every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 17 doses or more every 6 weeks (Q6W) of study treatment with
  pembrolizumab or a pembrolizumab-based combination or lenvatinib according to arm
  assignment. Participants who were in the Follow-up Phase in the parent study (post-treatment
  or Survival Follow-up Phase) will enter the Survival Follow-up Phase of this study.
  Participants who were in the Second Course Phase in their parent study will enter
  Second Course Phase of this study and complete up to 17 doses Q3W or 8 doses Q6W
  of study treatment with pembrolizumab or a pembrolizumab-based combination according
  to arm assignment.


  Any participant originating from a parent trial where crossover to pembrolizumab
  was permitted upon disease progression may be eligible for 35 doses as Q3W or 17
  doses Q6W of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years), if they progress while on the
  control arm and pembrolizumab is approved for the indication in the country where
  the potential eligible crossover participant is being evaluated.'
