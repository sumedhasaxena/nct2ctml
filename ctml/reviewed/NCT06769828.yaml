- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Age \u2265 20 years old"
- '* The surgical intervention for colorectal cancer aims for curative resection,
  with the goal of achieving a disease-free status that persists for six months or
  more, as assessed clinically and through imaging studies.'

  using the individual's post-surgery +/- adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapy
  minimum value as a baseline, a consecutive increase of more than 10% for two times

summary: This single-center, phase II clinical trial investigates the diagnostic efficacy
  of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET scans in detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence during
  post-treatment surveillance, particularly in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic
  antigen (CEA). The study compares the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of
  Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET with the conventional F-18-FDG PET scans, aiming to enhance recurrence
  detection in CRC patients who underwent curative surgery. Thirty participants will
  be enrolled and monitored through imaging studies and clinical follow-up.

      arm_description: Participants in this arm will undergo a Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET scan
        within 2-14 days after their F-18-FDG PET scan. Ga-68-FAPI-46 will be administered
        via intravenous injection at a dose of 1.8-2.2 MBq per kilogram of body weight,
        with a maximum dose of 200 MBq. The scan will be performed 30-90 minutes after
        injection. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Ga-68-FAPI-46
        PET in detecting colorectal cancer recurrence in patients with elevated serum
        carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), compared to F-18-FDG PET.
