prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Has a diagnosis of estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor
  receptor negative (HER2-) invasive breast carcinoma that is either locally advanced
  disease not amenable to resection or metastatic disease not treatable with curative
  intent'
- '* Has documented radiographic confirmation of disease progression during or after
  the last administered endocrine therapy (ET)'
- '* Provides additional tissue from the same sample used to determine ER and HER2
  status locally'
- '* Has received ET in the noncurative setting and has 1) Radiographic disease progression
  on 12 months or more of ET in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor in the noncurative
  setting or 2) Received at least 2 lines of ET in the noncurative setting including
  CDK4/6 inhibitor where the CDK 4/6 inhibitor was discontinued due to intolerance'
- '* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1
  assessed within 7 days of randomization'
- "* Participants who have AEs due to previous anticancer therapies must have recovered\
  \ to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with endocrine-related AEs who are\
  \ adequately treated with hormone replacement or participants who have \u2264Grade\
  \ 2 neuropathy are eligible"
- '* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible
  if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks
  prior to the first dose of study intervention and have undetectable HBV viral load
  prior to randomization'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has Breast cancer amenable to treatment with curative intent
- Exclude - * Is unable to receive any of the endocrine therapies (ETs) (ie, fulvestrant
  or exemestane)
- Exclude - * Has known difficulty in tolerating oral medications, unable to swallow
  orally administered medication, or conditions which would impair absorption of oral
  medications such as uncontrolled nausea or vomiting (ie, CTCAE =Grade 3 despite
  antiemetic therapy), ongoing gastrointestinal obstruction, motility disorder, malabsorption
  syndrome, or prior gastric bypass
- Exclude - * Has advanced/metastatic, symptomatic visceral spread at risk of rapidly
  evolving into life-threatening complications
- Exclude - * Has active, bleeding diathesis, or on oral anti-vitamin K medication
- Exclude - * Has history of noninfectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease including
  radiation pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial
  lung disease
- Exclude - * Has a known germline BRCA mutation (deleterious or suspected deleterious)
  and has received previous treatment with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition
  either in the adjuvant or metastatic setting
- Exclude - * Has received prior fulvestrant in the adjuvant, unresectable locally
  advanced, or metastatic setting
- Exclude - * Has received any line of cytotoxic chemotherapy or PARP inhibitor in
  the unresectable or noncurative advanced/metastatic setting
- Exclude - * Has received prior radiotherapy for non-central nervous system (CNS)
  disease or required corticosteroids for radiation-related toxicities including radiation
  pneumonitis, within 14 days of the first dose of study intervention
- Exclude - * Is currently receiving either a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4
  that cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study
- Exclude - * Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational
  agents within 4 weeks before randomization
- Exclude - * Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before
  the first dose of study intervention

  complications

summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of belzutifan
  (MK-6482) plus fulvestrant compared to everolimus plus endocrine therapy (ET) (investigator's
  choice of fulvestrant or exemestane) in adults with estrogen receptor-positive,
  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) unresectable metastatic
  breast cancer. There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study.
