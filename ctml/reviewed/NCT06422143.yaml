summary: This is a phase 3 study of pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/taxane
  (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) followed by pembrolizumab with or without maintenance
  sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT; MK-2870) in first-line treatment of metastatic
  squamous non-small cell lung cancer. It is hypothesized that pembrolizumab with
  maintenance sacituzumab tirumotecan is superior to pembrolizumab without sacituzumab
  tirumotecan maintenance with respect to overall survival (OS).
