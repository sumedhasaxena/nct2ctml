summary: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of golcadomide
  in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
  (R-CHOP) chemotherapy vs placebo in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy in participants
  with previously untreated high-risk large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).
