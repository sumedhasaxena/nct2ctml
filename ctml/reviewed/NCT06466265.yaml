  advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors who have been refractory to or had disease
  progression after standard treatment and have no other available standard treatment
  options.
- 3. Patients with at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response
  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

- 7. Patients who have recovered to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology
  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grade 1 or baseline status from
  reversible side effects of prior anticancer therapies (excluding alopecia \[regardless
  of grade\] or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or any laboratory test, blood pressure,
  and ECG results that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria).
- 8. For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test (urine-hCG and/or
  serum hCG) at the time of clinical trial participation.
- 9. For women of childbearing potential and men, no plans for pregnancy from screening
  to 24 weeks after treatment cessation and willingness to use appropriate contraception
  methods.
- 10. Voluntary written informed consent for clinical trial participation.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1\. At the screening visit, you have any of the following comorbidities:'
- Exclude - 1. Hematologic malignancies, including lymphoma.
- Exclude - 2. Interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis.
- Exclude - 3. Bowel obstruction or bowel perforation.
- Exclude - 4. Clinically significant pleural effusion, ascites, or pleural effusion.
- Exclude - 5. Severe infections or other uncontrolled active infectious diseases
  requiring treatment with antibiotics, antiviral drugs, etc. that may affect safety
  and efficacy evaluation during the clinical trial period, as determined by the investigator.
- "Exclude - 6. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) /diastolic\
  \ blood pressure (DBP) \u2265 160/100 mmHg)."
- Exclude - 7. QTc interval exceeding 480 msec (same criteria for both sexes) using
  Fridericia's QT correction formula.
- Exclude - 8. Active hepatitis B or C (hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) positive
  but HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) negative may be considered as previous infection
  and eligible for clinical trial).
- Exclude - 9. Clinically significant symptoms or uncontrolled central nervous system
  (CNS) metastases or carcinomatous meningitis (clinical trial eligibility is possible
  if no progression has been confirmed clinically and on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) for at least 4 weeks prior to the administration of investigational
  drugs after treatment for CNS or brain metastases and no treatment with steroids
  or other medications is required at least 2 weeks before administration of investigational
  drugs).
- 'Exclude - 2\. At the screening visit, individuals with the following medical history
  (including surgical/intervention history):'
- Exclude - 1. Major surgery or clinically significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
  prior to screening
- Exclude - 2. Significant cardiovascular disease such as unstable angina, myocardial
  infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, or unstable arrhythmia within 24 weeks
  prior to screening
- Exclude - 3. Immunosuppressive disease (e.g., acquired immune deficiency syndrome
  (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), etc.) or autoimmune disease
- Exclude - 4. Psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly
  affects the clinical trial
- 'Exclude - 3\. Subjects who have received the following drug therapies (pharmacological/non-pharmacological):'
- 'Exclude - 1. History of immunosuppressive medication within 2 weeks prior to baseline

  inhaled corticosteroids, and systemic corticosteroids with prednisolone equivalent
  to 10 mg/day or less are considered exceptions)'
- 'Exclude - 2. Other anticancer therapy (excluding investigational medicinal products
  and immune checkpoint inhibitors) within 3 weeks prior to baseline (Day 1 administration
  date) (Note: Point radiation for the purpose of relieving symptoms such as bone
  pain, bronchial obstruction, and skin lesions is allowed, but participation is not
  allowed if the subject has a history of nitrosoureas or mitomycin-C within 6 weeks
  prior to baseline)'
- Exclude - \*Radiation (chemo)therapy, chemotherapy, targeted agents (small molecule
  drugs, monoclonal antibodies), hormonal therapy, etc.
- Exclude - 3. History of immune checkpoint inhibitor administration within 4 weeks
  prior to baseline (Day 1 administration date) (e.g., anti-programmed cell death
  protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-PD-L2, anti-cluster
  of differentiation (CD) 137, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4),
  etc.)
