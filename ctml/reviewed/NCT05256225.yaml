summary: This phase III trial tests whether adding trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk
  (Herceptin Hylecta \[TM\]) or pertuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzxf (Phesgo
  \[TM\]) to the usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors
  in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are
  monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules
  (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab
  or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow
  are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune
  system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab
  in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase
  also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under
  the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab
  alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule
  agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin
  is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in
  a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than
  cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor
  cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
  may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2
  positive endometrial cancer.
