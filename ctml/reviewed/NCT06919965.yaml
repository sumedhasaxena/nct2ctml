prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion criteria:'
- '* Histologically confirmed diagnosis by local pathology of papillary-only HR-NMIBC
  (defined as high-grade Ta or any T1, no CIS). Mixed histology tumors are allowed
  if urothelial differentiation is predominant. However, neuroendocrine, and small
  cell variants will be excluded'
- '* Have a susceptible fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation or fusion
  either by urine testing or tumor tissue testing (from TURBT tissue) as determined
  by central or local testing'
- '* All visible tumor completely resected prior to randomization. Urine cytology
  must not be positive or suspicious for high grade UC before randomization. For participants
  with lamina propria invasion (T1) on the screening biopsy/TURBT, muscularis propria
  must be present to rule out MIBC'
- '* Participants must have had either: a. Adequate Induction (5 of 6 doses) and either
  2 of 3 doses of Maintenance or 2 of 6 doses of second Induction of BCG with high-grade
  T1 disease at first disease assessment after induction or high-grade Ta/any T1 disease
  within 6 months after last BCG (BCG-unresponsive population); b. had adequate induction
  (5 or 6 doses) with or without maintenance BCG with high-grade Ta/any T1 disease
  within 12 months after last BCG excluding BCG-unresponsive (BCG-experienced population);
  or c. been unable to complete an induction course of BCG with at least 5 doses due
  to grade \>= 2 toxicity requiring BCG discontinuation (BCG intolerant population)'
- '* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status Grade of
  0, 1, or 2'
- '* Must be ineligible for or refusing radical cystectomy (RC)'
- 'Exclusion criteria:'
- '* Presence of CIS at any point from time of diagnosis of papillary-only HR-NMIBC
  recurrence to randomization. Additionally, presence or history of histologically
  confirmed, muscle-invasive, locally advanced, nonresectable, or metastatic urothelial
  carcinoma (that is \[i.e.\], T2, T3, T4, N+, and/or M+)'
- '* Active malignancies (i.e., progressing or requiring treatment change in the last
  24 months) other than the disease being treated under study. Allowed recent second
  or prior malignancies: a. Any malignancy that was not progressing nor requiring
  treatment change in the last 12 months; b. Malignancies treated within the last
  12 months and considered at very low risk for recurrence for example (e.g.): non-melanoma
  skin cancers (treated with curative therapy or localized melanoma treated with curative
  surgical resection alone), non-invasive cervical cancer, breast cancer (adequately
  treated lobular CIS or ductal CIS, localized breast cancer and receiving antihormonal
  agents), localized prostate cancer (\[N0, M0\] with a Gleason score less than or
  equal to \[\<=\] 7a, treated locally only \[radical prostatectomy/radiation therapy/focal
  treatment\]) and other malignancy that is considered at minimal risk of recurrence'
- '* Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature that, in the opinion of
  the investigator, may prevent the safe placement, indwelling use, or removal of
  TAR 210'
- '* A history of clinically significant polyuria with recorded 24 hour urine volumes
  greater than (\>) 4,000 milliliters (mL)'
- '* Indwelling catheters are not permitted; however, intermittent catheterization
  is acceptable'

summary: "The main purpose of this study is to compare the disease-free survival (the\
  \ length of time after randomization that a participant survives without any signs\
  \ or symptoms of the cancer returning, or progressing) between Bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9\
  rin (BCG) treated participants receiving treatment with TAR-210 versus investigator's\
  \ choice of intravesical chemotherapy for treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive\
  \ bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC)."
