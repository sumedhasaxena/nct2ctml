- "* Participant must be \u226518 years of age or over the legal age of consent in\
  \ countries where that is greater than 18 years at the time of signing the informed\
  \ consent."
- '* Documented histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced non-squamous
  NSCLC, not suitable for definitive therapy or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC at screening
  (small cell or mixed histologies are excluded) (Stage III-IV NSCLC).'
- '* Documented activating HER2 mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) assessed
  by tissue molecular test in a CLIA-certified (US sites) or an equally accredited
  (outside of the US) local laboratory. However, participants may be included at the
  discretion of the investigator if the laboratory performing the assay is not CLIA
  or similar certified but the laboratory is locally accredited.'
- '* No prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. No prior
  treatment with a HER2 ex20ins-targeted therapy (e.g. poziotinib, trastuzumab deruxtecan).
  Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant
  therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to the start of screening.'
- '* Eligible to receive treatment with the selected platinum-based doublet-chemotherapy
  (i.e. cisplatin/pemetrexed or carboplatin/pemetrexed) and pembrolizumab in accordance
  with the SmPC/Product Information.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * Known history of prior malignancy except if the participant has undergone
  potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for five
  years since initiation of that therapy. Exception: the following cancer types are
  acceptable within five years if curatively treated or under surveillance:'
- Exclude - * a. in situ cancers of cervix, breast, or skin,
- Exclude - * b. superficial bladder cancer (Ta, Tis and T1),
- Exclude - * c. limited-stage prostate cancer,
- Exclude - * d. basal or squamous cancers of the skin.
- Exclude - * Tumors with targetable alterations with approved available therapy,
  with the exception of HER2 mutation in the TKD.
- Exclude - * Inability to discontinue treatment with chronic systemic corticosteroids.
  Participants who require intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled steroids,
  or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Replacement therapy
  (e.g., physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency)
  is acceptable, provided that the dose is stable for \>4 weeks prior to planned start
  of study intervention.
- "Exclude - * Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy that is Grade \u22652 by CTCAE (v5.0)."
- Exclude - * History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with a monoclonal
  antibody.
- Exclude - * Prior radiotherapy outside of the brain within 21 days before of planned
  start of study intervention. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related
  toxicities and not require corticosteroids.

summary: 'Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific genetic changes called human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations.


  Advanced NSCLC is a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or
  to other parts of the body or that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently
  available treatments. HER2 is a protein that helps cells to grow and divide. A damage
  (also called mutation) to the building plans (genes) for this protein in cancer
  cells leads to a production of abnormal HER2 and therefore abnormal cell growth
  and division.


  The study treatment, BAY 2927088, is expected to block the mutated HER2 protein
  which may stop the spread of NSCLC.


  The main purpose of this study is to learn how well BAY 2927088 works and how safe
  it is compared with standard treatment, in participants who have advanced NSCLC
  with specific genetic changes called HER2 mutations.


  The study participants will receive one of the study treatments:


  * BAY 2927088 twice every day as a tablet by mouth, or

  * Standard treatment in cycles of 21 days via infusion ("drip") into the vein. The
  treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any
  severe side effects or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment.


  During the study, the doctors and their study team will:


  * take imaging scans, including CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, of different parts of
  the body to study the spread of cancer

  * check the overall health of the participants by performing tests such as blood
  and urine tests, and checking

  * heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)

  * perform pregnancy tests for women

  * ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events
  they are having.


  An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors
  keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not
  to the study treatment.'
