summary: This open-label, multicenter, rollover study will provide continued treatment
  for participants deriving benefit from different therapies received in studies sponsored
  by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (DS) or DS/Astra Zeneca (AZ)-sponsored study (eg. DS8201-A-J101,
  DS8201-A-U201, DS8201-A-U204, DS8201-A-U207, DS8201-A-U303).

        will be provided the option to access the drug through standard of care (SoC)
        or other available options.


        Participants will remain on their current dosage regimen of T-DXd as the last
        dose administered in the parent study, unless they experience an AE that requires
        dose reduction at the EOT of the parent study, in which case the starting
        dose in this study will be the next lower dose-level.'
