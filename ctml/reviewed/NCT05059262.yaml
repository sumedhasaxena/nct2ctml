summary: 'This is a multicenter Phase 3 clinical study, which aims to evaluate the
  effectiveness of an investigational drug called vimseltinib for the treatment of
  tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) in cases where surgical removal of the tumor
  is not an option.


  The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, eligible study participants will be
  assigned to receive either vimseltinib or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number
  of assessments will be carried out during the course of the study, including physical
  examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires.
  MRI scans will be used to evaluate the response of the tumors to the treatment.
  Participants assigned to placebo in Part 1 will have the option to receive vimseltinib
  for Part 2. Part 2 is a long-term treatment phase in which all participants receive
  open-label vimseltinib.'
