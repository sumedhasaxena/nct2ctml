  and oxaliplatin-based) for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with documented
  radiographic disease progression on or after this line of therapy'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has medical history of (noninfectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)
  /pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis or has current ILD/pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis,
  or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis cannot be ruled out by imaging
  at screening

  of any of the following: amivantamab, cetuximab or bevacizumab or any component
  of FOLFIRI'
- Exclude - * Has a prior or concurrent second malignancy other than the disease under
  study or one whose natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any
  study endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the study treatment(s)
- Exclude - * Participant with known mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/ high microsatellite
  instability (MSI-H) status who has not received immunotherapy treatments
- Exclude - * Participant with known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-

summary: The purpose of this study is to compare how long the participants are disease-free
  (progression-free survival) and and the length of time until a participant dies
  (overall survival), when treated with amivantamab and chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil,
  leucovorin calcium (folinic acid) or levoleucovorin, and irinotecan hydrochloride
  (FOLFIRI) versus either cetuximab or bevacizumab and FOLFIRI given to participants
  with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene/ neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog
  (KRAS/ NRAS) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) wild-type
  recurrent, unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received
  chemotherapy.
