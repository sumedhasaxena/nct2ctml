- '* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or
  rectum. Participants must have recurrent, unresectable or metastatic disease'
- '* Be diagnosed to have KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type (WT) tumor as determined
  by local testing'

- '* Participant must have received 1 line of systemic therapy (fluoropyrimidine-based
  and oxaliplatin-based) for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with documented
  radiographic disease progression on or after this line of therapy'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Has medical history of (noninfectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)
  /pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis or has current ILD/pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis,
  or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis cannot be ruled out by imaging
  at screening

  of any of the following: amivantamab, cetuximab or bevacizumab or any component
  of FOLFIRI'
- Exclude - * Has a prior or concurrent second malignancy other than the disease under
  study or one whose natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any
  study endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the study treatment(s)
- Exclude - * Participant with known mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/ high microsatellite
  instability (MSI-H) status who has not received immunotherapy treatments
- Exclude - * Participant with known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-
  positive/amplified tumor
- Exclude - * Has prior exposure to irinotecan, any agents that target epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) or mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET)

summary: The purpose of this study is to compare how long the participants are disease-free
  (progression-free survival) and and the length of time until a participant dies
  (overall survival), when treated with amivantamab and chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil,
  leucovorin calcium (folinic acid) or levoleucovorin, and irinotecan hydrochloride
  (FOLFIRI) versus either cetuximab or bevacizumab and FOLFIRI given to participants
  with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene/ neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog
  (KRAS/ NRAS) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) wild-type
  recurrent, unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received
  chemotherapy.
