summary: 'This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed
  to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel
  T-Cell bispecific (TCB), glofitamab, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion as
  a single agent and in combination with obinutuzumab, following pre-treatment with
  a one-time, fixed dose of obinutuzumab. This entry-into-human (EIH) study is divided
  in 3 parts: dose escalation (Parts I and II) and dose expansion (Part III). Single-participant
  dose-escalation cohorts will be used in Part I, followed by conversion to multiple
  participant dose-escalation cohorts (Part II), in order to define a tentative maximum
  tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD). The expansion cohorts (Part
  III) will be initiated when the tentative MTD/OBD is defined, to further evaluate
  the safety, PK and therapeutic activity of glofitamab.'

        will be given on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and a total of 12 cycles will be administered.

        Combination Therapy: From Cycle 2 onwards, a fixed dose of 1000 mg obinutuzumab
        will be administered via IV infusion in combination with ascending doses of
        glofitamab on Day 1 of Q3W cycle until either the MTD/OBD is defined.


        Step-up dosing: Q3W, participants will receive an initial low dose of glofitamab
        on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by a higher dose on Cycle 1 Day 8; the total dose
        in Cycle 1 will not exceed the previously determined MTD. Higher doses may
