summary: 'Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have solid
  tumors with HER2-activating mutations. Before a treatment can be approved for people
  to take, researchers do clinical trials to better understand its safety and how
  it works.


  In this trial, the researchers want to learn how well BAY2927088 (sevabertinib)
  works in people with different types of solid tumors with HER2 mutations. These
  include tumors in the colon or rectum, the uterus and the cervix (lower part of
  the uterus), the breast, the bladder, and the biliary tract (includes gall bladder
  and bile ducts) as well as other types of solid tumors with the exception of people
  with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


  Solid tumors may have specific changes or mutations to a gene called human epidermal
  growth receptor-2 (HER2). This leads to the formation of an abnormal form of HER2
  protein in the cancer cells, resulting in increased cell growth. The study treatment,
  BAY2927088, is expected to block the abnormal HER2 protein which may stop the spread
  of cancer.


  The trial will include about 111 participants who are at least 18 years old. All
  the participants will take 20 mg of BAY2927088 as tablets by mouth.


  The participants will take treatments in 3-week periods called cycles. These 3-week
  cycles will be repeated throughout the trial. The participants can take BAY2927088
  until their cancer gets worse, until they have medical problems, or until they leave
  the trial.


  During the trial, the doctors will take imaging scans of different parts of the
  body to study the spread of cancer and will check heart health using echocardiogram
  or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrocardiogram (ECG). The doctors
  will also take blood and urine samples and do physical examinations to check the
  participants'' health. They will ask questions about how the participants are feeling
  and if they have any medical problems.'
