prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* STEP 1 REGISTRATION'
- 'Patients must:'
- 1. Have metastatic breast cancer, AND
- 2. Be initiating within 11 calendar days of Step 1 Registration OR be continuing
  trastuzumab-based HER-2 targeted therapy without concurrent anthracyclines, AND
- 3. Be receiving the trastuzumab-based HER-2 targeted therapy for metastatic disease
  in first, second, third-, or fourth-line setting. Patients may have brain metastasis.
  There is no limit for number of doses of HER-2 targeted therapy prior to registration.
- 'Examples of eligible HER-2 targeted therapy:'
- '* Trastuzumab or a trastuzumab biosimilar'
- '* Trastuzumab + chemotherapy or hormonal therapy'
- '* Trastuzumab + other HER-2 targeted agent with or without chemotherapy (such as
  pertuzumab, lapatinib, and tucatinib)'
- "* Ado-trastuzumab (Kadcyla\xAE)"
- '* Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) NOTE: Patients on lapatinib without trastuzumab
  are not eligible. Planned treatment with concurrent HER-2 targeted therapy and anthracyclines
  is not permitted.'
- '* Patients must be at increased risk for cardiotoxicity defined by at least one
  of the following:'
- 1. Previous anthracycline exposure OR
- '2. 1 or more of the following risk factors for heart disease:'
- '* LVEF 50-54% by local ECHO read\*'
- "* Age \u2265 65"
- "* BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2"
- '* Current or prior anti-hypertensive therapy'
- '* Diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD)'
- '* Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus'
- '* Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation/flutter Note: ECHO can be performed at any time
  prior to registration with the most recent being sent.'
- '* Patients must not have taken within 21 days prior to Step 1 Registration, be
  currently taking at the time of Step 1 Registration or planning to take once registered
  to Step 1 a beta blocker, ARB, or ACE inhibitor, in order to be randomized (Arms
  1 and 2).'
- Patients enrolling in the observational cohort (Arm 3) must be currently taking
  a beta blocker, ARB, or ACE inhibitor at the time of Step 1 Registration.
- '* Patients must have a Zubrod Performance status of 0-2'
- '* Patients must have a complete physical examination and medical history within
  28 days prior to registration'
- '* Patients must have LVEF \>= 50% echocardiogram (2D or 3D) within 28 days prior
  to registration. The echocardiogram must be obtained from a S1501 validated ECHO
  laboratory (lab) and submitted for central review by the S1501 ECHO core lab.'
- If a 3D echocardiogram is performed at baseline, sites must ensure that standard
  2D images, including 40chamber and 2-chamber views, are also obtained and submitted
  at subsequent timepoints.
- All follow-up echocardiograms (every 12 weeks) must be performed using 2D imaging
  to allow for standardized assessments. Follow-up scans must be completed at a site
  that can provide 2D images per protocol requirements. The echocardiograms cannot
  be submitted for central read until after Step 1 registration is complete.
- '* Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by all of the following
  within 28 days prior to registration:'
- '* Serum bilirubin \< 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)'
- '* Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
  and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \<
  5.0 x IULN'
- '* Patients must not be dialysis dependent'
- '* No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
  basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, prostate cancer
  on active surveillance, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient
  is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has
  been disease free for five years'
- '* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to potential fetal or nursing infant
  harm; women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
  method, a woman is considered to be of "reproductive potential" if she has had menses
  at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive
  methods, "effective contraception" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery
  intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined
  as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however,
  if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active
  during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol,
  he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures'
- '* Patients must be willing to submit blood specimens'
- '* Sites must seek additional patient consent for the future use of specimens'
- '* Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
  sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
  guidelines'
- '* For participants with impaired decision-making capabilities, legally authorized
  representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants
  in accordance with applicable federal, local, and CIRB regulations.'
- '* As a part of the OPEN registration process the treating institution''s identity
  is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional
  review board approval for this study has been entered in the system'
- '* STEP 2 REGISTRATION (Randomization)'
- '* Patients must not be registered to step 2 until confirming via RAVE EDC that
  the patient''s LVEF by echocardiogram was \>= 50% by central review. Patients must
  be registered within 21 calendar days of submission of the ECHO study/'
- '* Site must verify that there is no known change in the step 1 eligibility since
  initial registration'

summary: This trial has two cohorts of patients with human epidermal growth factor
  receptor (HER)-2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
  All patients must be receiving trastuzumab-based treatment. Both cohorts are being
  observed for cardiac toxicity. The largest cohort (currently open to accrual) is
  observational, and contains patients who are taking a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor,
  or ARB as well as their trastuzumab-based treatment. The goal is to understand how
  common cardiac problems are in this group of patients at high risk. The smaller
  cohort (currently closed to accrual) is randomized. Patients in this second cohort
  are randomized to either carvedilol or no treatment, with the goal of seeing whether
  carvedilol (used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure) may prevent the
  heart from side effects of chemotherapy.
