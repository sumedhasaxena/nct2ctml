summary: 'For patients with lung cancer who have undergone tumor resection, early
  relapse significantly impacts survival. However, there are currently no reliable
  screening or imaging tools available to identify patients at risk of early relapse.
  To address this clinical challenge, many studies have focused on understanding the
  clinicopathologic characteristics associated with an increased risk of early relapse.
  Despite these efforts, we can identify patients at risk but cannot pinpoint which
  individuals will actually experience early relapse. Studies on adjuvant therapy
  have shown improved survival in cases of more advanced disease but have not demonstrated
  a reduction in early relapse rates.


  In our preliminary analysis of previous study data, we observed that patients with
  a smaller reduction in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) within the first three days
  after surgery, followed by an increase on the third-day post-operation, are more
  likely to experience early relapse during regular monitoring. This pattern may be
  indicative of minimal residual disease. By combining trends in circulating tumor
  cell variations with pathologic characteristics, we aim to select patients for adjuvant
  therapy who are at high risk of developing early relapse.


  The objective of our study is to employ screening based on circulating tumor cell
  dynamics and pathologic features to identify patients likely to experience early
  relapse and to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy in these cases.'
