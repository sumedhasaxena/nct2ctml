summary: "This is a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label study, with an adaptive\
  \ design. The main objective of the study is to measure the efficacy and safety\
  \ of BT8009 (zelenectide pevedotin) as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab\
  \ in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC). The\
  \ study includes a dose selection phase followed by an adaptive design continuation.\
  \ The study is comprised of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will include participants who have\
  \ not received any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic UC\
  \ and are eligible to receive platinum-based chemotherapy, whereas Cohort 2 will\
  \ include participants who have received \u2265 1 prior systemic therapy for locally\
  \ advanced or metastatic UC."
