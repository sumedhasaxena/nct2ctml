- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.'
- '* Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 criteria.'
- '* Documentation of radiological disease progression after 1 prior line of platinum-containing
  chemotherapy (defined as at least 2 cycles of treatment) with or without therapy

- Exclude - * Chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI) time from the last dose of first-line
  platinum-containing chemotherapy to the occurrence of progressive disease) \< 30
  days (independent of the immunotherapy maintenance).

  exatecan derivatives, and similar agents targeting topoisomerase I.
- "Exclude - * Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous\
  \ meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate\
  \ provided they have stable CNS disease (ie, without evidence of progression) for\
  \ at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and all neurologic symptoms have returned\
  \ to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are taking\
  \ \u2264 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent."

summary: "The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about the study drug sacituzumab\
  \ govitecan (SG; Trodelvy\xAE; GS-0132; IMMU 132), versus standard of care (SOC)\
  \ in participants with previously treated extensive stage small cell lung cancer\
  \ (ES-SCLC).\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are to compare the effect of\
  \ SG to SOC on objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent\
  \ central review (BICR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\
  \ and to compare the effect of SG to SOC on overall survival (OS)."
