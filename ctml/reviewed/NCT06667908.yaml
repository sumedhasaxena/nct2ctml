- '* Must be a candidate for standard of care (SOC) treatment of non small cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC) by concurrent platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with radiation
  therapy (cCRT) followed by consolidation durvalumab treatment as determined by the
  investigator and per local guidelines at screening'

summary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether JNJ-90301900 added to concurrent
  platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with radiation therapy (cCRT) followed by consolidation
  immunotherapy (cIT) can improve objective response rate (ORR; that is percentage
  of participants whose best response is complete response or partial response during
  the study) in participants with locally advanced and unresectable stage III non-small
  cell lung cancer.
