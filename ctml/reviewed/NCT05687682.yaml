summary: 'This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study for a novel cancer
  treatment, AM-928, intravenous infusion antibody for advanced solid tumor. The study
  is aimed to learn the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy
  profile of AM-928.


  The dose escalation strategy will adopt accelerated titration combined with a Bayesian
  optimal interval (BOIN) design. Seven dose levels are designed and each participant
  will be assigned to a specific dose regimen depending on the time of enrollment.
  In the study, each participant will receive AM-928 treatment cycles till meeting
  any treatment discontinuation criterion and be followed for safety and long-term
  survival.


  The whole study is expected to take approximately three years to complete.'
