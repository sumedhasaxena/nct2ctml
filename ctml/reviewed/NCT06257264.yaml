prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Part 1 (Dose Escalation) Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Monotherapy Cohorts: Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed
  advanced or metastatic solid tumors potentially associated with CDK2 dependency
  including HR+/HER2- breast cancer, platinum refractory or resistant serous ovarian
  cancer (PROC), endometrial cancer, and others. Prior available standard-of-care
  systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease are required. The requirements
  for enrollment into a food effect evaluation cohort are the same as the monotherapy
  cohorts with the exception that participants with gastric cancer and gastroesophageal
  adenocarcinoma are excluded.'
- '* Combination Cohorts (BG-68501 with fulvestrant with or without BGB-43395): Enrollment
  is restricted to only participants with HR+/HER2- BC. In regions where approved
  and available, participants must have received one or more lines of treatment for
  advanced/metastatic disease as well as prior endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor
  in either the adjuvant or advanced/metastatic setting. If applicable, the requirements
  for enrollment into a food effect evaluation cohort are the same as the combination
  cohorts.'
- 'Part 1 (Safety Expansion) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion) Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participants with advanced, non-resectable, or metastatic HR+/HER2- BC or PROC,
  including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.'
- '* PROC participants must have received:'
- "* \u2265 1 line of platinum-containing chemotherapy for advanced disease."
- "* \u2264 4 prior therapeutic regimens in the advanced/metastatic setting."
- '* HR+/HER2- BC:'
- "* Participants enrolled in regions where CDK4/6 inhibitors are approved and available\
  \ must have received \u2265 1 line of therapy including endocrine therapy and a\
  \ CDK4/6 inhibitor. Participants can have received up to 2 lines of prior cytotoxic\
  \ chemotherapy or ADC treatments for advanced disease."
- 'General Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Female participants with advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- BC will be required
  to have ovarian function suppression using gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone
  (GnRH) agonists (such as goserelin) or be postmenopausal.'
- "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status \u2264 1."
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- "* For dose escalation, participants with advanced solid tumors other than HR+/HER2-\
  \ BC must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Participants with HR+/HER2- BC\
  \ with bone-only disease are eligible for dose escalation only. For safety expansion\
  \ and dose expansion, all participants must have \u22651 measurable lesion per RECIST\
  \ v 1.1."
- 'Exclude - General Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * For all cohorts: Prior therapy selectively targeting CDK2 inhibition.'
- 'Exclude - * For triple combination cohorts: Prior therapy targeting CDK2 or selectively
  targeting CDK4. Prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy is permitted and required in local
  regions where it is approved and available.'
- Exclude - * Known leptomeningeal disease or uncontrolled, untreated brain metastasis.
  Participants with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases may
  be eligible if they meet additional criteria.
- "Exclude - * Any malignancy \u2264 3 years before the first dose of study treatment(s)\
  \ except for the specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally\
  \ recurring cancer that has been treated with curative intent (eg, resected basal\
  \ or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, treated papillary thyroid\
  \ carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast)."
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled diabetes.
- "Exclude - * Infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral\
  \ therapy antiviral therapy \u2264 28 days before the first dose of study drug(s),\
  \ or symptomatic COVID-19 infection."
- Exclude - * Active hepatitis B infection or active hepatitis C infection.
- "Exclude - * Any major surgical procedure \u2264 28 days before the first dose of\
  \ study treatment(s)."
- Exclude - * Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or organ transplantation.
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1a/1b study of BG-68501, a cyclin-dependent
  kinase-2 inhibitor (CDK2i), to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
  (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-68501 in participants
  with advanced, nonresectable, or metastatic solid tumors as monotherapy and in combination
  with fulvestrant with or without BGB-43395, a selective CDK4 inhibitor, in adults
  with hormone receptor positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative
  (HER2-) breast cancer (BC). The study will also identify a recommended dose for
  expansion (RDFE) for BG-68501 as monotherapy and in combination for subsequent disease
  directed studies.


  The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation and safety expansion,
  including evaluation of food effect) and Part 2 (dose expansion).'
