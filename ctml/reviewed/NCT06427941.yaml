summary: 'This study is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 study of BGB-B2033 to assess
  the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
  antitumor activity of the BGB-B2033 in participants with advanced or metastatic
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer
  (GC), extragonadal yolk sac tumors, non-dysgerminomas, or glypican-3 (GPC3)-positive
  squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will also identify the recommended
  Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-B2033 alone and in combination with tislelizumab for
  subsequent studies. BGB-B2033 will be administered by intravenous infusion. The
  Phase 1 study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A (Monotherapy Dose Escalation
  and Safety Expansion) and Part B (Combination Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion).'
