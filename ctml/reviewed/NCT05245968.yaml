summary: This study consists of Dose escalation part and Expansion part. In Dose Escalation
  Part, the maximum tolerated dose of combination of pimitespib and imatinib in patients
  with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who are judged to be refractory to imatinib,
  estimate the recommended dose, evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics, and observe
  the antitumor effect. Expansion part consists of 3 arms. In Arm A, the efficacy
  and safety will be evaluated, which of the combination of pimitespib and imatinib
  in patients with GIST who have failed imatinib at doses below the MTD determined
  in Dose Escalation Part. In Arm B, the efficacy and safety of pimitespib monotherapy
  will be evaluated and the therapeutic effect of imatinib administration after pimitespib
  will be evaluated in an exploratory manner. In Arm C, the efficacy and safety of
  sunitinib monotherapy will be evaluated as reference data.
