prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Sign and date the Tissue Screening ICF, prior to any Tissue Screening procedure.
  Sign and date the Main ICF, prior to the start of any trial-specific qualification
  procedures.
- Sign and date the Optional PGx ICF (included in the Main Screening ICF) prior to
  any PGx procedure, and the Pregnant Partner ICF, if applicable.
- "2. Adults \u226518 years of age on the day of signing the ICF. Follow local regulatory\
  \ requirements if the legal age of consent for trial participation is \\>18 years\
  \ old."
- 3. Histologically documented non-squamous locally advanced unresectable or metastatic
- 'NSCLC and meets all of the following criteria:'
- 'Has Stage IV NSCLC disease or Stage IIIB or IIIC disease but is not a candidate
  for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation at the time of randomization
  (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition). Has no known
  AGAs (based on existing test result of local test) that have locally available therapies
  targeting their AGAs in the first-line advanced/metastatic setting. Has no known
  HER2 mutation based on existing test results (if approved or validated local test
  is available). Note: Participants with mixed histology are eligible if adenocarcinoma
  is the predominant histology. Mixed tumors will be classified based on the predominant
  cell type.'
- 4. Has not been treated with systemic anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic
  non-squamous NSCLC. Participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy other
  than those listed below, including ICI (ie, anti-PD-1/PD-L1) or a platinum-based
  regimen, are eligible if the last dose of adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was given
  at least 6 months before the date of the first trial dose and should not have progressed
  on or within 6 months of the last dose date of adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy.
- 1. Any agent, including an ADC, containing a chemotherapeutic agent targeting topoisomerase
  I.
- 2. HER2-targeted antibody-based anticancer therapy.
- 5. Has adequate tumor tissue sample (not previously irradiated) available for assessment
  of HER2 and PD-L1 expression by central or Sponsor-specified laboratory. A new biopsy
  is required if the participant's most recent archival tumor tissue sample cannot
  be supplied.
- Details pertaining to tumor tissue submission can be found in the Trial Laboratory
  Manual.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Has a medical history of MI within 6 months before randomization/enrollment
  or symptomatic CHF (NYHA Class II to Class IV). Participants with troponin levels
  above the ULN at Screening (as defined by the manufacturer) and without any MI-related
  symptoms should have a cardiologic consultation during the Screening Period to rule
  out MI.
- Exclude - 2. Has a QTc prolongation to \>480 ms based on the average of the Screening
  triplicate 12- lead ECG.
- Exclude - 3. Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids,
  has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled
  out by imaging at Screening.
- Exclude - 4. Has lung-specific, intercurrent, clinically significant illnesses including,
  but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (eg, pulmonary emboli within
  3 months of the trial randomization, severe asthma, severe COPD, restrictive lung
  disease, pleural effusion, etc.).
- Exclude - 5. Had a prior complete pneumonectomy.
