summary: 'Tremelimumab plus durvalumab (the STRIDE regimen) is an approved first-line
  therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it demonstrates
  limited efficacy, with an objective response rate (ORR) of only 20.1%. Radiation
  therapy (RT) is highly effective in controlling localized solid tumors and has become
  an integral component of the treatment algorithm for unresectable HCC. Preclinical
  studies have shown that combining RT with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade promotes immunogenic
  cell death and enhances antigen presentation by dendritic cells, thereby boosting
  systemic T cell-mediated antitumor responses in mouse models. The addition of CTLA-4
  inhibition further enhances antigen cross-priming following RT. Recent retrospective
  data also indicate that combining RT with immune-oncology agents is associated with
  improved overall survival and prolonged time to progression compared to RT or immunotherapy
  alone. However, the clinical benefit and immunologic impact of combining RT with
  tremelimumab and durvalumab have not yet been evaluated in prospective clinical
  trials for unresectable HCC.


  This phase II, single-arm clinical trial aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and
  immunologic effects of combining proton RT with tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients
  with unresectable HCC.'
