summary: The treatment protocol proposed in this study is to perform short-term radiation
  therapy and 4 cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of locally
  advanced rectal cancer. Compared to conventional chemoradiation therapy, the preoperative
  radiotherapy period is shortened, and the cure rate of rectal cancer patients can
  be improved by early treatment of micrometastasis using systemic chemotherapy. The
  patients who are assigned to the study group will received the short-course radiotherapy
  and 4 cycles of FOLFOX and patients in the control will received conventional chemoradiotherapy
  for preoperative treatment. All patients are recommended to receive total mesorectal
  excision (TME) after neoadjuvant treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy will be given
  according to the pathological stage.
