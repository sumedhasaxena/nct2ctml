summary: "This is a Phase \u2162, randomized, open-label, Sponsor-blinded, 3-arm,\
  \ global, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig in\
  \ combination with fluoropyrimidine and T-DXd (Arm A) compared to trastuzumab, chemotherapy,\
  \ and pembrolizumab (Arm B) in HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric\
  \ or GEJ adenocarcinoma participants whose tumors express PD L1 CPS \u2265 1. Rilvegostomig\
  \ in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy will be evaluated in a separate\
  \ arm (Arm C) to assess the contribution of each component in the experimental arm."
