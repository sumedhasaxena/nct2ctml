- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participant has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
  activities/procedures.'
- "* Age \u2265 18 years (or \u2265 legal age within the country if it is older than\
  \ 18 years) at the time of signing the informed consent."
- '* Participant must have histological, pathological, and/or cytological confirmation
  of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Mixed histologies (eg, adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine
  component) are not permitted.'
- "* mCRPC with \u2265 1 metastatic lesion that is present on baseline computed tomography\
  \ (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scan imaging obtained within 28\
  \ days prior to enrollment."
- '* Evidence of progressive disease, defined as 1 or more PCWG3 criteria:'
- '* Serum PSA progression defined as 2 consecutive increases in PSA over a previous
  reference value measured at least 1 week prior. The minimal start value is 2.0 ng/mL.'
- "* Soft-tissue progression defined as an increase \u2265 20% in the sum of the diameter\
  \ (SOD) (short axis for nodal lesions and long axis for non-nodal lesions) of all\
  \ target lesions based on the smallest SOD since treatment started or the appearance\
  \ of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions."
- '* Progression of bone disease: defined by the appearance of at least 2 new bone
  lesion(s) by bone scan (as per the 2+2 PCWG3 criteria).'
- '* Participants must have had a prior orchiectomy and/or ongoing androgen-deprivation
  therapy and a castrate level of serum testosterone (\< 50 ng/dL or \< 1.7 nmol/L).'
- '* Prior progression on at least one ARDT (enzalutamide, abiraterone, apalutamide,
  darolutamide).'
- '* Prior treatment with only one taxane therapy in the mCRPC setting. Note: Prior
  treatment with docetaxel in the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC)
  setting is permitted; however, participants must have also received one, and only
  one, taxane therapy in the mCRPC setting.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.'
- '* Adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Prior \& Concomitant Therapy:'
- Exclude - * Prior six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1)-targeted
  therapy.
- Exclude - * Any anticancer therapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agent within
  4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, not including androgen suppression
  therapy (eg, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone/gonadotropin-releasing hormone
  \[LHRH/GnRH\] analogue \[agonist/antagonist\]).
- Exclude - * Prior Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy
  (RLT) within 3 months of the first dose of study treatment unless participants received
  \< 2 cycles of therapy.
- Exclude - * Prior palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of first dose of study
  treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities.
- 'Exclude - * Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy, ARDT, immunotherapy, radioligand
  therapy, PARP inhibitor, biological therapy, investigational therapy. Note: Prior
  treatment with a PARP inhibitor is permitted as long as not within 4 weeks before
  first dose of study treatment.'
- Exclude - * Prior radionuclide therapy (Radium-223) within 2 months of first dose
  of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Treatment with live and live-attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks before
  the first dose of study treatment.
- 'Exclude - Disease Related:'
- 'Exclude - * Participants with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.
  Note: Participants with treated, asymptomatic, and clinically stable dural metastases
  are eligible.'
- Exclude - * Unresolved toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy not having resolved
  to CTCAE version 5.0 events grade above 1 or baseline, with the exception of alopecia
  or toxicities that are stable and well controlled AND there is an agreement to allow
  inclusion by both the investigator and the sponsor.
