summary: 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and a leading
  cause of cancer-related death. The majority of participants first presenting with
  HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study
  is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and efficacy of livmoniplimab
  in combination with budigalimab.


  Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HCC.
  There are 2 stages to this study. In Stage 1, there are 3 treatment arms and participants
  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab
  (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug),
  atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, or tremelimumab in combination with
  durvalumab. In Stage 2, there are 2 treatments arms and participants will be randomized
  in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (optimized dose)
  in combination with budigalimab or tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab.
  Approximately 660 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 185 sites
  worldwide.


  Stage 1: In arm 1, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab
  (Dose 1) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In arm 2, participants
  will receive IV infused livmoniplimab (Dose 2) in combination with IV infused budigalimab,
  every 3 weeks. In Arm 3 (control), participants will receive the investigator''s
  choice: IV atezolizumab in combination with IV bevacizumab every 3 weeks or single
  dose IV tremelimumab in combination with IV durvalumab every 4 weeks. Stage 2: In
  arm 1, participants will receive IV infused livmoniplimab (optimized dose) in combination
  with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In Arm 2 (control), participants will
  receive single dose IV tremelimumab in combination with IV durvalumab every 4 weeks.
  All participants will continue treatment until disease progression or discontinuation
  criteria are met, whichever occurs first. The estimated duration of this study is
  about 56 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests,
  questionnaires, and scans.'
