summary: This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, study of JNJ-90014496, an
  autologous bi-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting
  both cluster of differentiation (CD) CD19 and CD20, for the treatment of adult participants
  with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) or frontline
  high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
