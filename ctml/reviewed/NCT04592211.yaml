summary: Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody
  (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) receptor,
  thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and
  programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2). Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor (PARP1,
  2, and 3) that is being developed as a monotherapy as well as for combination with
  chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, and other anti-cancer agents including novel agents
  and immunotherapy. Paclitaxel is widely used in breast, lung and gastric cancer
  with every 3-week or weekly cycle. Various targeted anticancer agents have been
  investigated with paclitaxel and combination with ramucirumab, a monoclonal anti-VEGFR2
  antibody, was approved as a 2nd line treatment.
