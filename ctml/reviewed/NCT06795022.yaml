- "* Age \u2265 18 at the time of signing the informed consent."
- '* GPC3 positive tumour as determined by a central laboratory using an analytically
  validated IHC assay.'
- '* Must have at least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria
  in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status (ECOG PS): 0-1 at screening.'
- "* Predicted life expectancy of \u2265 12 weeks."

  dose as defined by the protocol.'
- '* Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations,
  as defined by the protocol.'
- '* Confirmed advanced recurrent and/or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC, which
  is histopathologically proven based on the criteria established by the World Health
  Organization.'
- '* Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B (that is not eligible for locoregional
  therapy) or stage C.'
- '* Child-Pugh Score class A.'
- '* Previous therapy:'
- 'Part A: Patients who have received at least one prior line of standard systemic
  therapy for HCC as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network or other local scientific
  guidelines and for which a clinical study is the best option for next treatment
  based on prior response and/or tolerability and/or patient/investigator decision.'
- 'Part B: Patients must not have received more than one prior line of systemic therapy
  in the advanced recurrent and/or metastatic setting.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Unresolved toxicity from prior anticancer therapy, including imAEs,\
  \ of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade \u2265 2 except\
  \ for vitiligo, peripheral neuropathy related to prior anti-cancer therapy, alopecia,\
  \ endocrine disorders that are controlled with replacement hormone therapy and asymptomatic\
  \ laboratory abnormalities."
- Exclude - * Prior to enrolment, participation in another clinical study with an
  investigational product administered in the last 21 days or 5 half-lives whichever
  is shorter.
- Exclude - * CAR-T cell therapy within the last 6 months prior to enrolment on this
  study.
- Exclude - * Known allergy or hypersensitivity to AZD9793 or any of the excipients
  of the product as outlined in the IB.
- Exclude - * Requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (including steroids \> 10
  mg prednisone/day or equivalent).
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with any therapy that is targeted to GPC3.
- Exclude - * Received radiation within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment;
  palliative radiation to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) or CRS/neurotoxicity
  in participants with bulky disease is permitted.
- Exclude - * Undergone a major surgical procedure within 14 days prior to first dose
  of study treatment days to allow adequate healing
- Exclude - * Experienced unacceptable cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or Immune Effector
  Cell Associated Neurotoxicity (ICANS) following prior T cell engagers (TCE) or chimeric
  antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy.
- Exclude - * Previous history of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) / macrophage
  activation syndrome (MAS).
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders within
  3 years of start of treatment.
- Exclude - * Cardiac conditions as defined by the protocol.
- Exclude - * History of thromboembolic event within the past 3 months prior to the
  scheduled first dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Central nervous system (CNS) metastases or CNS pathology, as defined
  by the protocol, within 3 months prior to consent.
- Exclude - * Infectious disease including active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
  and uncontrolled active systemic fungal, bacterial or other infection.
- Exclude - * Known fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, or combined hepatocellular
  malignant cholangiocarcinoma.

summary: This research is designed to determine if experimental treatment with AZD9793,
  a T cell-engaging antibody that targets GPC3, is safe, tolerable and has anti-cancer
  activity in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours which are GPC3+.
