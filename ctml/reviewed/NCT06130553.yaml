summary: This is a first time in human (FTiH) Phase I/IIa, open-label, multi-centre
  study of AZD3470 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with MTAP
  deficiency. The study consists of several study modules, evaluating the safety,
  tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of
  AZD3470 as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents.
