summary: This is a Phase I, prospective, dose-finding study to evaluate the safety,
  persistence, and clinical activity of GF-CART01 in subjects aged 18-70 with relapsed
  or refractory (R/R) B-cell hematological malignancies and failure of two-line or
  more standard chemotherapies or auto-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).This
  study is a traditional 3+3 dose-escalation design to observe dose-limiting toxicity
  (DLT), establish the maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D),
  and preliminary efficacy of GF-CART01. RP2D may equal to or lower than MTD
