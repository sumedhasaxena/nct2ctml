summary: The goal of this First-In-Human (FIH) Phase I/II trial is to establish the
  safety profile, determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), explore the pharmacokinetic
  (PK) exposure and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties as well as assess the efficacy
  of STX-241/PFL-241, a mutant selective Central Nervous System (CNS)-penetrant fourth
  generation EGFR TKI, in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that
  progressed during or following third generation EGFR TKI such as osimertinib due
  to C797X double acquired (secondary) mutations.
