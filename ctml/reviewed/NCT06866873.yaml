  or flow cytometry analysis on the last biopsy available.'
- '* Age 1-17 years.'
- "* Performance status: Subjects \\> 10 years of age: Karnofsky \u2265 50%; Subjects\
  \ \u2264 10 years of age: Lansky scale \u2265 50%."
- '* Normal organ function.'
- "* Total bilirubin \u2264 3 times upper limit of normal"
- "* AST (SGOT) \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal"
- "* ALT (SGPT) \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal"
- "* Serum Creatinine \u2264 2 times upper limit of normal"
- '* Subjects must have the following hematologic function parameters: Hemoglobin
  (Hb) level \> 8 g/dL; Absolute Lymphocyte Count \> 0.1x10\^9/L; Platelet \> 50x10\^9/L'
- '* Prior therapy wash-out. At least 2 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter,
  must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned
  for leukapheresis.'
- '* Subjects'' parent or legal guardian must have the ability to understand and the
  willingness to sign a written informed consent document.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Autologous transplant within 6 weeks of planned CAR T cell infusion.
- Exclude - * Recipient of CAR-T cell therapy outside of this protocol.
- Exclude - * Active central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement by tumor.
- Exclude - * History of additional active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
  cancer, carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast).
- Exclude - * Active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
- Exclude - * Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
  to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social
  situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
- Exclude - * Evidence of myelodysplasia or cytogenetic abnormality indicative of
  myelodysplasia on any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy.
- Exclude - * Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection.

summary: This study seeks to examine the efficacy and safety of the administration
  of autologous T cells that have been modified through the introduction of a chimeric
  antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the B cell surface antigen CD19 following administration
  of chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen in children with relapsed or refractory
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma. The overall goal of this study is
  to validate the safety profile of administration CD19-CAR T cells and describe the
  response rate in children with relapsed/refractory ALL or lymphoma.
