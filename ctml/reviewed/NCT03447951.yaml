- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Male or female, \u2265 20 years and \u2264 80 years of age."
- '* Patients with clinically confirmed primary HCC following American Association
  for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD, Appendix 1) guidance:'
- 1. Cyto-histological evidence, or
- 2. Coincident imaging evidence using computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI)
- '* Based on investigator discretion, patients who are diagnosed at Barcelona Clinic
  Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B and are ineffective or unsuitable for resection, immediate
  liver transplantation, Trans Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE), or current local
  ablative treatment and meet all of the following conditions at study entry:'
- "1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u2264 1."
- 2. Child Pugh score class A or B.
- "* Patients with at least one measurable lesion with size \u2265 1 cm."
- "* Patients with cumulative total treated tumor volume \u2264 366 cm3 and \u2264\
  \ 4 target tumors."
- '* Patients with adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function within 28 days prior
  to study entry, as defined by the following:'
- 1. Hemoglobin \> 10.0 g/dl.
- 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1,500/mm3.
- 3. Platelet count \> 80k/mm3 correctable by component therapy.
- "4. Albumin \u2265 3 g/dl."
- 5. Total bilirubin \< 2 mg/dL.
- 6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \< 5 x upper
  normal limit (UNL).
- 7. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine \< 1.5 x UNL.
- 8. International normalized ratio (INR) \< 1.5 or prothrombin time (PT) \< 15 seconds.
- '* Patients with life expectancy \> 3 months as judged by investigator.'
- '* Patients who understand and comply to the study procedure and be willing to provide
  a written informed consent form.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - * Infiltrative HCC or tumor burden \u2265 50% of liver parenchyma."
- Exclude - * Patients with cumulative total treated tumor volume \> 366 cm3 or more
  than 4 target tumors.
- Exclude - * Any target tumor exceeds 8.8 cm in diameter.
- Exclude - * The treated tumor is located in close proximity to another organ (e.g.
  gall bladder, liver capsule, diaphragm ) or major blood vessel and less than 0.5
  cm in distance .
- Exclude - * Presence of metastasis or vascular invasion.
- Exclude - * Systemic chemotherapy treatment for HCC within 12 weeks prior to study
  entry.
- Exclude - * Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry (e.g. thoracolaparotomy
  is not allowed, but noninvasive surgery, e.g. biopsy, is allowed).
- Exclude - * Use of any investigational drugs, biologics, or devices within 4 weeks
  prior to study entry or planned use during the course of study.
- Exclude - * Any other severe disease (e.g. active infection, uncontrolled diabetes
  mellitus, severe heart dysfunction or angina, gastric ulcer, active auto-immune
  disease) judged by the investigator to limit subject participation in the study.
- Exclude - * Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing
  potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test performed within seven days
  prior to the start of study drug and agree to practice medically acceptable contraceptive
  regimen from screening until at least 28 days after the study treatment. Patients
  who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year (\> 12 months since the last menstrual
  cycle) or were surgically sterilized do not require the pregnancy test.
- Exclude - * Known or suspected allergy and/or hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients
  of PTS100.
- Exclude - * Any target lesion blocked by bile ducts or important blood vessels,
  judged by investigator, that is difficult to conduct intratumoral injection.
- Exclude - * Any condition, judged by investigator, that shows subjects are not suitable
  for participation.
