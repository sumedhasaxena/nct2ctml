summary: 'The "PACIFIC" trial confirmed that the consolidation therapy with durvalumab
  in patients with stage III, locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC that had not progressed
  after definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy improved the progression-free
  survival (PFS) by about 17 months. However, in PACIFIC, no significant differences
  between durvalumab and placebo were observed in PFS. Unmet need remains in development
  of successful consolidation therapy following chemoradiation therapy in patients
  with EGFR-mutant stage III unresectable NSCLC.


  A recent "ADAURA" study showed that Osimertinib as an adjuvant therapy after surgery
  significantly prolonged disease-free survival in EGFR mutation-positive patients.
  Lazertinib, like Osimertinib, is a third-generation EGFR TKI agent and has shown
  excellent anticancer effects in preclinical studies and in early clinical settings.
  Based on these results of the 3rd generation EGFR TKI, Lazertinib, it is expected
  that there is a clinical benefit Lazertinib as consolidation therapy.


  This study aims to investigate the clinical benefits of Lazertinib (Trade name:
  LECLAZA Tab) consolidation therapy for patients with EGFR mutation-positive, unresectable
  stage III NSCLC after definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.'
