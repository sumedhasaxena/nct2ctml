prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Age \u2265 18 years at the time of signing informed consent."
- '* Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally
  advanced solid tumors who have relapsed after and/or are refractory to or ineligible
  for established and available therapies with known clinical benefit at time of pre-screening:'
- '* Group A: NSCLC, CRC, GC, and melanoma.'
- '* Group B: NSCLC, CRC, GC.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status 0 or 1.'
- '* Life expectancy of \> 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator.'
- '* At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Note:
  this lesion should be avoided for the required biopsies on the study.'
- '* Participants must be willing to undergo 1 or more biopsies as follows:'
- '* Fresh biopsy prior to enrollment is preferred or, if fresh tissue is not obtainable,
  an archival tumor sample may be acceptable if the sample was obtained within 6 months
  of enrollment and participant has not received any other treatment since sample
  was obtained, consult the Medical Monitor.'
- "* Mandatory fresh biopsy during cycle 2 (before the restaging of CT-scan) of treatment\
  \ with AMG 355 (\xB1 pembrolizumab)."
- 'Note: Where slides are accepted, samples must consist of a minimum of 11 (21 preferred)
  freshly-cut, serially, sectioned, unstained slides. A formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
  block is preferred if available, but in lieu of a block, unstained slides or fresh
  wet tissue is acceptable.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Participant who received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
  or anti PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory
  T-cell receptor (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \[CTLA-4\], OX
  40, CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to an immune-related adverse
  events.
- 'Exclude - * Untreated or symptomatic brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease
  Note: participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
  they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least
  4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during
  study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment
  for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.'
- Exclude - * Chronic intake of systemic corticosteroids (eg prednisone \> 10 mg/day
  or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior
  to the first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
  in past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
  drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine or insulin) is not considered a form
  of systemic treatment and is allowed.
- Exclude - * History of organ transplantation.
- Exclude - * History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that
  required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.
- Exclude - * History of any immune-related colitis. Infectious colitis is allowed
  if evidence of adequate treatment and clinical recovery exists and at least 3 months
  interval observed since diagnosis of colitis.
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.

summary: 'The primary objectives of this study are to:


  * Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 355 as monotherapy and in combination
  with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors

  * Determine the recommended phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose for AMG
  355 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced
  solid tumors.'
