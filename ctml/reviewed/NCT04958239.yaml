summary: 'This study is open to adults with advanced cancer (solid tumors) and people
  with advanced head and neck cancer. The study has 2 parts. The purpose of Part 1
  of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 765179 that people
  with solid tumors can tolerate when taken alone or together with a medicine called
  ezabenlimab. The goal of Part 2 is to find out whether BI 765179 in combination
  with a medicine called pembrolizumab helps people with advanced head and neck cancer.


  In Part 1, each participant is put into 1 of 2 groups. Participants get BI 765179
  alone or in combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.
  In Part 2, participants are also divided into 2 groups. 1 group gets a low dose
  of BI 765179 in combination with pembrolizumab and the other group gets a high dose
  of BI 765179 in combination with pembrolizumab. Participants receive the study treatment
  as infusions into a vein.


  BI 765179, ezabenlimab, and pembrolizumab are antibodies that may help the immune
  system fight cancer. In this study, BI 765179 is given to people for the first time.


  Participants can stay in the study up to 2 years if they benefit from treatment
  and can tolerate it. The doctors regularly check the participants'' health and note
  any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.'
