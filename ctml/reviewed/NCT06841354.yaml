summary: Researchers want to know if sacituzumab tirumotecan given alone or with pembrolizumab
  can treat triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The main goal of this study is to
  learn if people treated with sacituzumab tirumotecan alone or with pembrolizumab
  live longer overall or without the cancer growing or spreading compared to people
  treated with chemotherapy.
