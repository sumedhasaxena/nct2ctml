summary: 'The goal of this study is listed below.


  Part A (Safety Run-in Phase) : To determine feasibility of pembrolizumab and nesuparib
  combination as maintenance therapy in patients with MMR-proficient advanced and
  recurrent endometrial cancer. Feasibility is defined as a dose-limiting toxicity
  (DLT) rate less than or equal to 33%.


  Part B (Randomization Phase)


  : To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab and nesuparib combination/ pembrolizumab
  monotherapy as maintenance therapy in patients with MMR-proficient advanced stage
  and recurrent endometrial cancer. Efficacy will be assessed by investigator assessed
  progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by RECIST 1.1.'
