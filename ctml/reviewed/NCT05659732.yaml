  test 7 days prior to the administration of PEP07.

  polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or a rapid antigen test (RAT) test on Day -7/Day
  1.

  radiotherapy, hormonal, or any investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives
  (whichever is shorter), or immunotherapy within 30 days prior to the first dose
  of PEP07. Patients who have received hydroxyurea or dexamethasone at any time prior

  to first study drug administration after enrollment.
- Exclude - 13. Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal
  involvement.
- 'Exclude - 14. Patients who have had any of the following within 6 months prior
  to first administration of PEP07 after enrollment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable

summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is


  * To assess the safety and tolerability of PEP07 administered orally as a single
  dose and at escalating dose levels, and, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity
  (DLT) of study treatment in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Mantle
  Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

  * To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose
  (RP2D) of PEP07 monotherapy.


  Participants will receive PEP07 administered orally once daily (QD) for 2 consecutive
  days and 5 days off, every week for 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable
  toxicity, confirmed pregnancy, death, consent withdrawal, HSCT or other anti-cancer
  treatment is required, or the Sponsor ends the study, whichever occurs first.'
