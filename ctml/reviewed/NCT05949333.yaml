summary: Patients who experienced neutropenia after receiving pegfilgrastim on day
  1 of the first round are randomly assigned to either the control or experimental
  arm. Patients in the control arm continue pegfilgrastim injection on day 1 while
  patients in the experimental arm will receive pegfilgrastim injection on day 3 to
  see if changing the pegfilgrastim administration date from day 1 to day 3 starting
  from the second round of chemotherapy could reduce the incidence of neutropenia
