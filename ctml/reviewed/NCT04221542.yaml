        The dose exploration phase of the study will estimate the maximum tolerated
        dose (MTD) of AMG 509 using a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM; Neuenschwander
        et al, 2008).


        Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) may be identified based on emerging safety,
        efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) data, as well as patient experience
        prior to reaching an MTD. Alternative dosing schedule(s) (including a third
        step dose) may be explored based on emerging efficacy, safety, PK data and
        patient experience.


        During the dose-expansion phase, individual cohorts of participants from China
        will be enrolled with a safety lead-in at 1 dose level below the MTD or RP2D
        followed by evaluation at the MTD or RP2D to confirm the safety, tolerability,
        MTD and/or RP2D of AMG 509 in Chinese participants.'
