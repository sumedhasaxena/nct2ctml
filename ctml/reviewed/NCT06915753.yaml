  FGFR4 gene, or focal amplifications of FGF19'
- '* Archival tumor tissue biopsy specimen no older than 2 years from the time of
  enrollment, if available. If a tissue biopsy specimen is not available, a biopsy
  is not required.'
- '* At least 1 measurable lesion by RECIST v1.1.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - All Patients:'
- Exclude - * Have disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative
  intent.
- Exclude - * Have not recovered from reversible toxicity of prior anticancer therapy
  to \< Grade 1 or baseline (except toxicities that are not clinically significant
  or not expected to resolve, including but not limited to, alopecia, fatigue, skin
  discoloration, or Grade 1 neuropathy).
- 'Exclude - * Have received the following anticancer therapy:'
- Exclude - 1. Any immunotherapy or other antibody therapy within 28 days prior to
  the first dose of the study drug.
- Exclude - 2. A TKI \< 5 days or 5X the terminal Phase elimination half-lives, whichever
  is longer, prior to the first dose of TYRA-430.
- Exclude - 3. Other systemic therapy not listed above \< 14 days prior to the first
  dose of the study drug.
- "Exclude - * Participant discontinued a prior anti-FGFR therapy due to significant\
  \ toxicity, defined as hepatotoxicity \u2265 Grade 3 or any Grade 4 toxicity according\
  \ to CTCAE v5.0."
- Exclude - * Has a serum phosphorus level \> upper limit of normal (ULN) during screening
  that remains \>ULN despite medical management.
- Exclude - * History of or current uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.
- Exclude - * Active, symptomatic, or untreated brain metastases.
- Exclude - * Have a diagnosis of primary CNS malignancies.
- Exclude - * Gastrointestinal disorders that will affect oral administration or absorption
  of TYRA-430.
- Exclude - * Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant
  and males who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study.
- Exclude - * Any reason that, in the view of investigator, would substantially impair
  the ability of the participant to comply with study procedures and increase the
  risk to the participant.
- 'Exclude - Part B, Cohort 1:'
- Exclude - * Known fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, or mixed cholangiocarcinoma
  and HCC.
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with pan-FGFR inhibitors or FGFR4-selective inhibitors.
