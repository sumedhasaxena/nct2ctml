  initial disease), or any other underlying primary malignancies excluding carcinoma
  in situ or resectable skin cancer.
- Exclude - 2. Subjects have received chemotherapies within 2 years, or a major abdominal
  surgery or radiotherapy within 4 weeks before the trial enrollment.
- Exclude - 3. Subjects are known to be allergic to any of the studied chemotherapeutics.
