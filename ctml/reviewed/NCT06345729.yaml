summary: "This is a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of MK-1084 with pembrolizumab\
  \ as first-line treatment in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small\
  \ cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with identified Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\
  \ G12C (KRAS G12C) mutation and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion\
  \ score (TPS) \u226550%. There are two primary study hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 1:\
  \ Combination of MK-1084 and pembrolizumab is superior to placebo plus pembrolizumab\
  \ with respect to progression free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria\
  \ in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review\
  \ (BICR).\n\nHypothesis 2: Combination of MK-1084 plus pembrolizumab is superior\
  \ to placebo plus pembrolizumab with respect to overall survival (OS)."
