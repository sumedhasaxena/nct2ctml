summary: 'The main purpose of the study is to assess whether the study drug, LY4066434,
  is safe and tolerable when administered to participants with locally advanced or
  metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS mutations. LY4066434 will be given alone
  or in combination with other treatments. The study will have 2 parts: monotherapy
  dose escalation and dose optimization. The study is expected to last up to approximately
  5 years.'
