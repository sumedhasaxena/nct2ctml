prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Males and females \u2265 18 years of age."
- '* Pathological diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC.'
- "* Stage IB (T2 \u2265 4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC after complete surgical resection\
  \ and received platinum-based chemotherapy."
- '* For programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing, tumor tissue from the resected
  site of disease must be sent, received, and analyzed for biomarkers.'
- '* Treated with platinum-based chemotherapy:'
- 1. Chemotherapy must have begun within 12 weeks after the resection surgery.
- 2. The last chemotherapy dose must have been completed at least 3 weeks and no more
  than 12 weeks before the participant is randomized.
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0 or 1.'
- '* Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and
  ROS-1 negative.'
- '* Have adequate organ function as indicated by laboratory values.'
- '* Absence of severe comorbidities that in the opinion of the investigator might
  hamper participation in the study and/or treatment administration.'
- '* Participants must sign approved informed consent form (ICF).'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Evidence of disease.
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 and anti-PD-L1/2
  modulating agents in adjuvant setting.
- Exclude - * History or presence of immune-mediated disorders.
- Exclude - * Participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism
  due to autoimmune thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders
  not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll.
- Exclude - * Participant has positive screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis
  C (HCV).
- Exclude - * History of congenital immunodeficiency diseases, prior allogeneic stem
  cell transplantation, or organ transplantation.
- Exclude - * History of any other malignancy other than NSCLC within 5 years prior
  to screening, except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
  nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer treated with surgery, etc.
- Exclude - * Known clinically significant history of liver disease consistent with
  Child-Pugh Class B or C, including active viral or other hepatitis virus, current
  alcohol abuse or cirrhosis.
- "Exclude - * Surgery or chemotherapy-related toxicity not resolved to grade 1 with\
  \ the exception of grade \u2264 2 alopecia, fatigue, neuropathy, and lack of appetite/nausea."
- Exclude - * Woman of childbearing potential who is pregnant or is breast feeding.
- Exclude - * Woman of childbearing potential who is not consenting to use highly
  effective methods of birth control.
- Exclude - * Man with a partner of childbearing potential who does not consent to
  use highly effective methods of birth control.
- Exclude - * Participant has known hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies or to
  any of the excipients of the investigational product (IP).
- Exclude - * Active cardiac disease or history of cardiac dysfunction, that in the
  judgment of the investigator would place the participant at additional risk when
  participating in the study.
- Exclude - * Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease
  that required steroids or has current neumonitis/interstitial lung disease.
- Exclude - * Live vaccine therapy within 4 weeks prior to IP administration.
- Exclude - * Participation in another investigational drug study within 30 days prior
  to IP administration.
