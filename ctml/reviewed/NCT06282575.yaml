summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zanidatamab
  plus CisGem (Cisplatin and Gemcitabine) with or without the addition of a programmed
  death protein 1/ligand-1 (PD-1/L1) inhibitor (physician's choice of either Durvalumab
  or Pembrolizumab, where approved under local regulations) as first line of treatment
  for participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive biliary
  tract cancer.
