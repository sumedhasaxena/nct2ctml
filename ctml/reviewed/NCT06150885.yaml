summary: This study is composed of phase I and IIa parts. The dose-escalation phase
  I part aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to identify the safety
  of CAR001 in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumor; the dose-expansion phase
  IIa part aims to evaluate the potential efficacy of CAR001 in subjects with relapsed/refractory
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), colorectal
  cancer (CRC) or Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
