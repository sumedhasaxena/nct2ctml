  \ within 10 to 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. The subject may not receive\
  \ study drug until the study doctor has verified that the results of pregnancy tests\
  \ are negative. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless\
  \ they are naturally postmenopausal (at least 24 months consecutively amenorrhoeic\
  \ \\[amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential\\\
  ] and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically\

  of study drug, continue during study treatment (including during dose interruptions),
  and for 12 months after study drug discontinuation. Female subjects must also refrain
  from breastfeeding for 12 months following last dose of study drug. If the below
  contraception methods are not appropriate for the FCBP, she must be referred to
  a qualified contraception provider to determine the medically effective contraception
  method appropriate for the subject. The following are examples of highly effective
  and additional effective methods of contraception:'
- 'Examples of highly effective methods:'
- '* Intrauterine device (IUD)'
- '* Hormonal (ovulation inhibitory combined \[estrogen and progesterone\] birth control
  pills or intravaginal/transdermal system, injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing
  intrauterine system \[IUS\], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation
  inhibitory progesterone-only pills \[e.g. desogestrel\]) NOTE: There is a potential
  for tazemetostat interference with hormonal contraception methods due to enzymatic
  induction.'
- '* Bilateral tubal ligation'
- '* Partner''s vasectomy (if medically confirmed \[azoospermia\] and sole sexual
  partner).'
- 'Examples of additional effective methods:'
- '* Male latex or synthetic condom,'
- '* Diaphragm,'
- '* Cervical Cap'
- 'NOTE: Female subjects of childbearing potential exempt from these contraception
  requirements are subjects who practice complete abstinence from heterosexual sexual
  contact. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and
  usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
  or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.'
- 19. All study participants enrolled must be registered into the applicable pregnancy
  prevention program (e.g. REVLIMID REMS in the US, Pregnancy Prevention Programme
  \[PPP\] in Europe, RevAid in Canada) for lenalidomide to be administered and be
  willing and able to comply with the requirements of the applicable program as appropriate
  for the country in which the drug is being used.
- a. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must adhere to the scheduled
  pregnancy testing as required in theapplicable pregnancy prevention program. During
  study treatment, FCBP must agree to have pregnancy testing weekly for the first
  28 days of study participation and then every 28 days for FCBP with regular or no
  menstrual cycles OR every 14 days for FCBP with irregular menstrual cycles. FCBP
  must also have a pregnancy test at end of lenalidomide treatment, at days 14 and
  28 following the last dose of lenalidomide and at overall treatment discontinuation
  (at the End-of-Treatment/30-day safety Follow-up visit). Female subjects exempt
  from this requirement are subjects who have been naturally postmenopausal for at
  least 24 consecutive months OR have had a total hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.
- 20. Male subjects must either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a latex
  or synthetic condom, even with a successful vasectomy (medically confirmed azoospermia),
  during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP from first dose of study drug,
  during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after
  study drug discontinuation.

  during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after
  study drug discontinuation.'

summary: 'The participants of this study would have relapsed/refractory follicular
  lymphoma.


  Follicular lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It is referred to as ''relapsed''
  when the disease has come back after a period of improvement after that follows
  a treatment regimen and ''refractory'' when treatment no longer works.


  Stage 1 of this trial will study the safety and the level that adverse effects of
  each of the study drug combinations can be tolerated (known as tolerability). It
  is also designed to establish a recommended study drug dosage for stage 2 and 3.
  Stage 1 of the study is completed.


  Stages 2 and 3 will evaluate and compare how long participants live without their
  disease getting worse when receiving the study drug in combination with other drug
  treatment versus the placebo (dummy drug) in combination with other drug treatment.'
