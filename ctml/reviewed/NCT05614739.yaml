  in tumor or blood sample that is deemed as actionable'
- '* Cohort A1: Presence of an alteration in FGFR3 or its ligands'
- '* Cohort A2, B2, B3, and B5: Histological diagnosis of urothelial cancer (UC) that
  is locally advanced or metastatic with a qualifying FGFR3 genetic alteration'
- '* Cohorts B1 and B4: Histological diagnosis of urothelial cancer that is locally
  advanced or metastatic'

- '* Cohort A1 and B3: Measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by Response
  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)'
- '* Cohorts A2, B1, B2, B4, B5, and C1: Measurable disease required as defined by
  RECIST v1.1'
- '* Have adequate tumor tissue sample available. Participants with inadequate tissue
  sample availability may still be considered for enrollment upon review'

- '* Cohort A1/C1: Participant has received all standard therapies for which the participant
  was deemed to be an appropriate candidate by the treating Investigator; OR the participant
  is refusing the remaining most appropriate standard of care treatment; OR there
  is no standard therapy available for the disease. There is no restriction on number
  of prior therapies.'
- '* Cohort A2, B2, B3 participants must have received at least one prior regimen,
  and cohorts B1 and B4 participants at least 2 prior regimens, in the locally advanced

- "* Cohort B2, B5, and C1: Participants must be FGFR inhibitor na\xEFve"
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Participants with primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy
- Exclude - * Untreated or uncontrolled CNS metastases
- Exclude - * Current evidence of corneal keratopathy or retinal disorder. Individuals
  with asymptomatic ophthalmic conditions may be eligible
- Exclude - * Any serious unresolved toxicities from prior therapy
- Exclude - * Significant cardiovascular disease
- Exclude - * Prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's
  formula (QTcF)
- Exclude - * Active uncontrolled systemic infection or other clinically significant
  medical conditions
- Exclude - * Participants who are pregnant, lactating, or plan to breastfeed during
  the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study treatment. Participants who
  have stopped breastfeeding may be enrolled

summary: The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety, side effects,
  and effectiveness of LOXO-435 by itself or when it is combined with other standard
  medicines that treat cancer. LOXO-435 may be used to treat cancer of the cells that
  line the urinary system and other solid tumor cancers that have a change in a particular
  gene (known as the FGFR3 gene). Participation could last up to 30 months (2.5 years)
  and possibly longer if the disease does not get worse.
