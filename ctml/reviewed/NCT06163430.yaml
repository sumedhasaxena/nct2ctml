summary: 'The goal of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
  pharmacodynamics and efficacy of TERN-701, a novel highly selective allosteric inhibitor
  of BCR-ABL1, in participants with previously treated chronic phase - chronic myeloid
  leukemia (CP-CML).


  The study has two parts: Part 1 of the trial (Dose Escalation) will evaluate sequential
  dose escalation cohorts of TERN-701 administered once daily.


  Part 2 (Dose Expansion) consists of randomized, parallel dose expansion cohorts
  of TERN-701 that will further evaluate the efficacy and safety of at least 2 recommended
  dose levels for expansion selected from Part 1.


  In both Part 1 and Part 2, participants will receive continuous daily dosing of
  TERN-701 divided into 28-day cycles. During the treatment period, participants will
  have scheduled visits to the trial center at Cycle 1 day 1(C1D1), C1D2, C1D8, C1D15,
  and C1D16, followed by Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 7, and Day 1 of every 3 cycles
  thereafter.


  Approximately 100 participants could be enrolled in this trial, including up to
  60 participants in Part 1 (dose escalation), including optional backfill cohorts,
  and approximately 40 participants in Part 2 (randomized dose expansion).


  All participants will receive active trial intervention.


  At least 4 dose-level cohorts may be evaluated in Part 1; at least 2 dose levels
  may be evaluated in Part 2.'
