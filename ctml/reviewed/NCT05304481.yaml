summary: This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, Phase II clinical study to
  investigate the efficacy and safety profiles of autologous ATL administration in
  HCC patients after curative treatment. Among all the eligible patients, ratio of
  7:2:1 for Stage I:II:IIIa of the HCC will be the enrolled strategy of the study
  to reflect the results of the previous study (Lee, Lee et al. 2015).
