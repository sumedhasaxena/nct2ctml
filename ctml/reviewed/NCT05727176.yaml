prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable
  intrahepatic of extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.
- 2. Documented evidence of FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangement
- 3. Received at least one prior systemic gemcitabine and platinum-based regimen for
  CCA
- 4. Documentation of radiographic disease progression on the most recent prior therapy
- 5. Measurable disease
- 6. performance status 0 or 1
- 7. Adequate organ function
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. History or current evidence of calcium and phosphate homeostasis disorder
- Exclude - 2. Current evidence of clinically significant retinal disorder
- 'Exclude - 3. Treatment with any of the following within the specified time frame
  prior to the first dose of futibatinib:'
- Exclude - 1. Major surgery within the previous 4 weeks (the surgical incision should
  be fully healed prior to the first dose of futibatinib) and radiotherapy for extended
  field within 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy within 2 weeks
- Exclude - 2. Patients with locoregional therapy, eg, transarterial chemoembolization
  (TACE), selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) or ablation within 4 weeks
- Exclude - 3. Any non investigational anticancer therapy within 3 weeks or have not
  recovered from side effects of such therapy prior to futibatinib. Endocrine therapy
  is allowed for patients with breast or prostate cancer
- Exclude - 4. Targeted therapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks or within 5 half lives
  Any investigational agent received within 5 half-lives of the drug or 4 weeks, whichever
  is shorter.
- Exclude - 5. Patients with prior FGFR-directed therapy
- 'Exclude - 4. A serious illness or medical condition(s) including (but not limited
  to) the following:'
- "Exclude - 1. Known brain metastasis (not including primary brain tumors) unless\
  \ patient is clinically stable for \u22651 month"
- Exclude - 2. Known acute systemic infection
- Exclude - 3. Myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, symptomatic congestive
  heart failure (New York Heart Association \[NYHA\] Class III or IV New York Heart
  Association \[NYHA\] Classification) within the previous 2 months; if \>2 months,
  cardiac function must be within normal limits and the patient must be free of cardiac-related
  symptoms
- Exclude - 4. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s) that could interfere with
  the absorption of futibatinib.
- Exclude - 5. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
  abnormality that in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient inappropriate
  for entry into this study.
- Exclude - 5. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active
  treatment, with the exception of patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy
  whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with
  the safety or antitumor assessment of the investigational regimen. Exceptions must
  be discussed with the Sponsor prior to patient enrollment.
- Exclude - 6. Pregnant or lactating female.
- Exclude - 7. Known hypersensitivity or severe reaction to futibatinib or its excipients.

summary: This is an open-label, multinational, randomized Phase 2 study confirming
  the clinical benefit of 20 mg futibatinib and evaluating the safety and efficacy
  of 16 mg futibatinib in previously treated CCA harboring FGFR2 gene fusions and
  other rearrangements.
