- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.'
- '* Is previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; metastatic
  disease must have been diagnosed within the past 3 months; and subject is expected
  to receive standard treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Subjects who
  have had planned or prior surgery, such as a Whipple procedure, with or without
  neo-adjuvant/or adjuvant chemotherapy may be included.'
- "* Life expectancy \u2265 3 months."
- '* Measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) scan by RECIST v1.1 criteria.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1.'
- "* Adult, age \u2265 18 years, male or female."
- '* Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
  within 14 days prior to start of study treatment and must use an adequate method
  of contraception from 2 weeks before the first administration of SBP-101 until 6
  months after the last administration of study drug (i.e., last dose of any of the
  three drugs in the regimen). Female subjects are considered to be of childbearing
  potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months of consecutive amenorrhea,
  without other known or suspected cause) and over 55 years old or have been sterilized
  surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy,
  all with surgery at least one month before dosing).'
- '* Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function as outlined in protocol.'
- "* QTc interval \u2264 470 ms (for women) and \u2264 450 ms (for men) on the ECG\
  \ at baseline calculated by either the Fridericia or Framingham formula."
- '* Willing and able to provide written informed consent: voluntary agreement to
  participate in the study following disclosure of risks and procedures required.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * When results of germline or somatic testing done prior to screening
  are known, subjects known to have mutations of the BRCA 1/2 (Breast Cancer gene)
  are excluded.
- Exclude - * Concomitant metformin administration. Diabetic subjects on treatment
  with metformin, or any other derivative thereof, must discontinue it at least 5
  days prior to C1D1 and not take metformin while on study (other diabetic medications
  are allowed).
- Exclude - * Any history of retinopathy or at risk for retinal detachment (personal
  or family history of retinal detachment, extreme myopia \[-6.0 diopters or approximately
  20/500\], eye surgery \<6 months prior to C1D1, or history of a severe eye injury.
  Subjects with findings of retinopathy on baseline ophthalmology exams will be excluded.
- Exclude - * Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent
  condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, makes it
  undesirable for the subject to participate in the study or that would jeopardize
  compliance with the protocol. Subjects with pre-existing well-controlled diabetes
  are not excluded.
- Exclude - * Medical or psychiatric conditions that compromise the subject's ability
  to give informed consent or to complete the protocol or a history of non-compliance.
- Exclude - * Presence of islet-cell or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor or mixed adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine
  carcinoma.
- Exclude - * Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Screening
  of asymptomatic subjects without history of CNS metastases is not required.
- Exclude - * Serum albumin \< 30 g/L (3.0 g/dL).
- Exclude - * Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or portal vein occlusion, pulmonary embolism
  (PE), or other thromboembolic event that occurs during screening.
- Exclude - * Presence of known active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection requiring
  systemic therapy.
- Exclude - * Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis
  B or C.
- Exclude - * Presence of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, or pulmonary
  hypersensitivity reaction.
- Exclude - * Myocardial infarction within the last 12 months, severe/unstable angina,
  symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III
  or IV.
- Exclude - * Pregnant or lactating.
- Exclude - * Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the start of study drug treatment,
  without complete recovery.
- Exclude - * Known hypersensitivity to any component of study treatments.
- Exclude - * Participation in any other clinical investigation within 4 weeks of
  receiving the first dose of study drug.
- "Exclude - * Any history of hydroxychloroquine use (Plaquenil\xAE and other brand\
  \ names)."
