prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Presence of metastasized or locally advanced, unresectable (curative intent),
  histologically proven, well differentiated Grade 1 or Grade 2 (Ki-67 \<10%) gastroenteropancreatic
  neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) diagnosed within 6 months prior to screening.'
- '* Participants with high disease burden in the Investigator''s opinion. Following
  criteria should be used as the guiding principle for determining high disease burden:'
- '* Primary tumor or a metastatic lesion \> 4 cm'
- '* More than one tumor or metastatic lesions measuring \> 2 cm'
- '* Elevated alkaline phosphatase \> 2.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)'
- '* Presence of bone metastasis'
- '* Presence of peritoneal metastasis'
- '* Symptoms due to tumor volume such as pain, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia etc.'
- '* Symptoms due to hormone excess requiring active management'
- '* Additionally, participants who, in the Investigator''s opinion, have high disease
  burden due to their disease characteristics not specified above could also be considered
  eligible.'
- "* Participants \u2265 12 years of age."
- '* RLI somatostatin receptor (SSTR) uptake on all target lesions (defined by RECIST
  v1.1 criteria) at least as high as normal liver uptake assessed within 3 months
  prior to randomization. Any of the RLI modalities as available (some examples are
  listed below) can be used as per local practice:'
- '* \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT or PET/MRI'
- '* \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT or PET/MRI'
- '* \[64Cu\]Cu-DOTA-TATE PET/CT or PET/MRI'
- '* Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) (planar and/or SPECT/CT) with \[111In\]In-pentetreotide'
- '* SRS (planar and/or SPECT/CT) with \[99mTc\]Tc-octreotide.'
- '* Adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory
  values prior to receiving the first study treatment:'
- "* White blood cell (WBC) count \u2265 2 x 109/L"
- "* Platelet count \u2265 75 x 109/L"
- "* Hemoglobin (Hb) \u2265 8 g/dL"
- '* Creatinine clearance \> 40 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft Gault method'
- "* Total bilirubin \u2264 3 x ULN"
- '* Potassium within normal limits. Potassium level of up to 6.0 millimoles per liter
  (mmol/L) is acceptable at study entry if associated with creatinine clearance within
  normal limits calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula. Mild decrease (grade 1)
  below lower limit of normal (LLN) is acceptable at study entry if considered not
  clinically significant by Investigator.'
- '* ECOG performance status 0-1.'
- '* Presence of at least 1 measurable site of disease.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Prior administration of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for GEP-NET
  at any time prior to randomization in the study.
- Exclude - * Any previous therapy with interferons, mTOR-inhibitors, chemotherapy
  or other systemic therapies except somatostatin analogues (SSAs) of GEP-NET. If
  as per Investigator's opinion a participant is candidate for such therapies, such
  participant must not be enrolled.
- Exclude - * Participant who received more than 4 cycles of prior SSAs (e.g., octreotide
  long-acting release) are not eligible. In addition, any participant receiving treatment
  with short-acting octreotide, which cannot be interrupted for 24 h before the administration
  of \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTA-TATE, or any participant receiving treatment with SSAs, which
  cannot be interrupted for at least 4 weeks before the administration of \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTA-TATE.
- Exclude - * Documented RECIST v1.1 progression during previous SSA treatments for
  the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Any previous radioembolization, chemoembolization and radiofrequency
  ablation for GEP-NET.
- Exclude - * Any major surgery within 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.
- Exclude - * Known brain metastases.
- Exclude - * Participant with known intolerance to CT scans with intravenous (i.v.)
  contrast due to allergic reaction or renal insufficiency. If such a participant
  can be imaged with MRI, then the participant would not be excluded.
- Exclude - * Hypersensitivity to any somatostatin analogues, to the Investigational
  Medicinal Products (IMPs) active substance or to any of the excipients.
- Exclude - * Active severe urinary incontinence, severe voiding dysfunction, or urinary
  obstruction requiring an indwelling/condom catheter that, in the judgment of the
  Investigator, could prevent adhering to radiation safety instructions.
- Exclude - Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.

summary: The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
  \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus octreotide long-acting release (LAR) versus octreotide
  LAR alone in newly diagnosed patients with somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+),
  well differentiated Grade1 and Grade 2 (G1 and G2) (Ki-67 \<10%) advanced gastroenteropancreatic
  neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) with high disease burden
