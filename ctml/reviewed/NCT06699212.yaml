  congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
  illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
- "Exclude - * Prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy or radiation\
  \ therapy within 2 weeks of C1D1 or has not recovered (i.e., Grade \u2264 1 or at\
  \ baseline) from adverse events (AEs) due to previously administered agent"

  \ or intervention within 4 weeks of C1D1 or has not recovered (i.e., Grade \u2264\
  \ 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to previously administered agent"
- Exclude - * Prior receipt of ASP-1929 at any time

  \ vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed;\
  \ however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist\xAE) are live attenuated\
  \ vaccines, and are not allowed"
- Exclude - * Requiring future examinations or treatments within 4 weeks after an
  ASP-1929 PIT treatment exposing the patient to significant light (e.g., eye examinations,
  surgical procedures, endoscopy) that is unrelated to the ASP-1929 PIT treatment
- Exclude - * Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks before
  randomization, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of
  study treatment

summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if ASP-1929 photoimmunotherapy
  (PIT) in combination with pembrolizumab works to treat recurrent squamous cell cancer
  of the head and neck (HNSCC) with no distant metastases. It will also learn about
  the safety of ASP-1929 PIT in combination with pembrolizumab.


  Researchers will compare ASP-1929 PIT in combination with pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab
  alone or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin, plus 5-fluorouracil
  or paclitaxel or docetaxel) according to physician''s choice (control arm).


  The overall primary study hypothesis being tested is whether ASP-1929 PIT plus pembrolizumab
  combination treatment improves the overall survival (OS) of the population defined
  by the inclusion/exclusion criteria over the control arm.'
