  dose of APL-101, symptomatic or unstable arrhythmia requiring medical therapy, history

  \ had an opportunistic infection within the past 12 months prior to first dose of\

  (drugs with known QTc risk and known strong cytochrome P450 \[CYP\]3A4 inducer and/or
  strong inhibitors) for at least 5 half-lives prior to first dose of study drug.
  Subjects may qualify if such medication(s) can be safely replaced with alternate
  medications with less risk of drug-drug interaction.
- Exclude - 14. Subjects with active COVID-19 infection.
- Exclude - 15. Symptomatic and/or neurologically unstable CNS metastases, or who
