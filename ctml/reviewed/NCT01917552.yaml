- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Pregnant or lactating women.

  angina, symptomatic coronary artery disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade
  II or greater congestive heart failure or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication
  or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.'
- Exclude - * Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or those
  who have malabsorption syndrome likely to influence absorption of capecitabine,
  or inability to take oral medication.
- Exclude - * Serious uncontrolled intercurrent infections or other serious uncontrolled
  concomitant disease.
- Exclude - * Organ allografts requiring immunosuppressive therapy.
- Exclude - * Received any investigational drug or agent/procedure, i.e. participation
