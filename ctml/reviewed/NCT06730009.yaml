summary: "This is a phase I/II study which intends to characterize the safety, tolerability,\
  \ and preliminary efficacy of Allogeneic Magicell-NK infusion in PDA or cholangiocarcinoma\
  \ patients after surgery. Subjects will receive a total of 6 intravenous (IV) infusions\
  \ of the IP on the 11th day of each chemotherapy cycle. A total of 6 cycles of IP\
  \ infusions are planned.\n\nThe phase I part of the study is a first-in-human phase\
  \ I trial of Allogeneic Magicell-NK and is therefore designed in an open-label,\
  \ dose-escalation manner. A standard 3+3 design will be employed to assess the safety\
  \ profile of Allogeneic Magicell-NK and to determine the MTD/MFD. Two dose cohorts\
  \ are planned: the starting dose is 10 \xD7 10\\^8 cells (Cohort 1), and escalates\
  \ to 20 \xD7 10\\^8 cells (Cohort 2).\n\nThe phase II part of the study is designed\
  \ as an open-label, two-arm, randomized clinical trial comparing the combination\
  \ of SLOG and Allogeneic Magicell-NK with SLOG alone when used as adjuvant therapy\
  \ following resection for PDA or Cholangiocarcinoma. Approximately 30 subjects will\
  \ be randomized at a 2:1 ratio between the two arms: Arm 1: SLOG and Allogeneic\
  \ Magicell-NK (20 subjects); Arm 2: SLOG alone (10 subjects). Subjects will then\
  \ receive 12 weeks of SLOG chemotherapy with or without Allogeneic Magicell-NK infusion."
