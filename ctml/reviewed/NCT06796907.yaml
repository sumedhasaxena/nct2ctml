prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Participants must be 18 years of age inclusive or older, at the time of signing
  the informed consent, or the legal age of consent in the jurisdiction in which the
  study is taking place.'

- 1. Adjuvant +/- neoadjuvant considered one line of therapy
- 2. Maintenance therapy will be considered as part of the preceding line of therapy
  (i.e., not counted independently)
- 3. Unplanned addition or switching to a new drug in a different class is considered
  a separate line of therapy. If an agent in a regimen is switched to another agent

  this is considered part of the same line (i.e. not counted independently).
- '* Requirements for tumor tissue samples: Archival or fresh tumor tissue is required
  for retrospective central assessment of B7H4 expression by immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) and other biomarker analysis. The archival tumor tissue should be from the
  most recent procedure (ideally obtained after the last anti-cancer treatment). If
  an archival tissue is not available a new biopsy should be performed, and the newly
  obtained tissue provided.'
- "* Participants have at least one target lesion as assessed per RECIST 1.1. A target\
  \ lesion is defined as a measurable lesion that has not undergone locoregional treatment\
  \ such as irradiation or that has unequivocal progression following locoregional\
  \ treatment, with the longest diameter of \u2265 10 millimeter (mm) at Baseline\
  \ (for lymph node lesions, the short axis should be \u2265 15 mm)."

- 2. Participants who have progressed on or are intolerant to at least 1 line of standard
  prior systemic therapy (including neoadjuvant or adjuvant as prior line), and who
  are not candidates for curative external radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Maintenance
  therapy will be considered part of the preceding line of therapy (i.e, not counted
  independently).

  \ ligand 1 (PD\\[L\\]-1) anti-cancer therapy."
- 'Inclusion criteria of participants under arm Module 2 (GSK5733584 +/- Bevacizumab)
  Ovarian Cancer Part A:'
- a. Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced epithelial
  ovarian cancer/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer (any epithelial histology - mucinous,
  clear cell, carcinosarcoma, high/low grade serous, endometrioid) who have failed

  of study intervention for Arms 1 to 3 and 11 Months after the last dose of study
  intervention for Arm 4:'

  and one of the following conditions applies:'
- '* Is a Woman of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) OR'
- '* Is a Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and using a contraceptive method
  that is highly effective'

summary: Advanced solid tumors are cancers that have spread to other parts of the
  body. While many treatments exist, most people become resistant to them, and the
  cancer returns. Researchers are developing new treatments that combine different
  medicines for those who do not respond to single medicine. This study is looking
  at how safe and tolerable GSK5733584 is, how the body handles it, and how well it
  works when used with other cancer medicines. The study will include participants
  with advanced solid tumors who have either not responded to standard treatments
  or cannot tolerate them or have no available effective treatment.
