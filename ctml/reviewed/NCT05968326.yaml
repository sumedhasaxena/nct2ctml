summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant
  autogene cevumeran plus atezolizumab and modified leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
  irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) versus mFOLFIRINOX alone in participants
  with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who have not received prior
  systemic anti-cancer treatment for PDAC and have no evidence of disease after surgery.
