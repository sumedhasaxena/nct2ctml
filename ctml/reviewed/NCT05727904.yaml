prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Participant has a histologically or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage
  IIIC, IIID, or IV unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
- 2. In the investigator's assessment, the participant has an Eastern Cooperative
  Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and an estimated life expectancy
  of \> 6 months.
- 3. Participant is assessed as having at least one resectable lesion (or aggregate
  lesions) for lifileucel generation.
- 4. Participant must have at least one measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1
  following tumor resection.
- 5. Participants must have adequate organ function.
- 6. Participants of childbearing potential or those with partners of childbearing
  potential must be willing to practice an approved method of highly effective birth
  control.
- 7. Participants who are \> 70 years of age may be allowed to enroll after the investigator
  discusses with the medical monitor.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Participant has melanoma of uveal/ocular origin.
- Exclude - 2. Participant has symptomatic untreated brain metastases.
- Exclude - 3. Participant received more than 1 prior line of therapy.
- Exclude - 4. Participant received prior therapy for metastatic disease
- Exclude - 5. Participants with a BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor received prior
  adjuvant/neoadjuvant ICI therapy only
- Exclude - 6. Participant has an active medical illness(es) that, in the opinion
  of the investigator, would pose increased risks for study participation, such as
  systemic infections; seizure disorders; coagulation disorders; or other active major
  medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune systems.
- Exclude - 7. Participant has any form of primary or acquired immunodeficiency (eg,
  SCID or AIDS).
- Exclude - 8. Participant had another primary malignancy within the previous 3 years
  (except for those that do not require treatment or were curatively treated \>1 year

- Exclude - 9. Participant has a history of allogeneic cell or organ transplant.
- Exclude - Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.

summary: This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group, treatment
  study to assess the efficacy and safety of lifileucel in combination with pembrolizumab
  compared with pembrolizumab alone in participants with untreated, unresectable or
  metastatic melanoma. Participants randomized to the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm
  who subsequently have a blinded independent central review- verified confirmed progressive
  disease (PD) will be offered lifileucel monotherapy in an optional crossover period.
