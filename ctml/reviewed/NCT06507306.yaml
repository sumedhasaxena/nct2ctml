summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if KQB198 works to treat advanced
  solid tumor cancer in adults. It will also learn about the safety of KQB198. The
  main questions it aims to answer are:


  * What is the safe dose of KQB198 by itself or in combination with other anti-cancer
  drugs?

  * Does KQB198 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs decrease the
  size of the tumor?

  * What happens to KQB198 in the body?


  Participants will:


  * Take KQB198 daily, alone or in combination with another anti-cancer drug

  * Visit the clinic about 8 times in the first 8 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks
  after that'
