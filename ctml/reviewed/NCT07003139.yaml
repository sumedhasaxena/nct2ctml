- 10. Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative result of serum
  pregnancy test at the screening visit and urine pregnancy test before the B10 L-BPA
  administration. However, if the subject has been menopausal for at least 2 years
  (more than 24 months since the last menstrual period) or uses surgical birth control,
  testing is not required.
- "11. Female subject with childbearing potential as well as male subject with reproductive\
  \ potential must agree to refrain from unprotected sex and use 2 methods of highly\
  \ effective contraception with their partner (e.g. barrier contraceptives \\[male\
  \ condom, female condom, or diaphragm plus spermicide\\], intrauterine device, hormonal\

- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Patients with malignant brain tumors complicated by any of the following
  conditions:'
- Exclude - * Extracranial metastases.
- Exclude - * Multiple intracranial lesions on both sides.
- Exclude - 2. The investigator assesses that the subject has concurrent infections
  or other malignant tumors and is not suitable to participate in the trial.
- Exclude - 3. Patients with malignant brain tumors are considered eligible for standard
  surgical treatment that is effective against the tumor.
- Exclude - 4. A time interval less than 3 months from previous radiation therapy
  for intracranial region.
- Exclude - 5. A time interval less than 3 months from last brain surgery (excluding
  drainage procedures and biopsy) and less than 1 month from previous chemotherapy.
- "Exclude - 6. The adverse event of previous anti-tumor therapy were NCI-CTCAE V5.0\
  \ grade evaluation \u2267 Class 3 (excluding alopecia and peripheral neuropathy)."
- Exclude - 7. Received or expect to receive any investigational drug, biologic or
  device within 1 month prior to the scheduled BNCT.
- Exclude - 8. Patients receiving or expected to receive vascular endothelial growth
  factor inhibitors (except bevacizumab) or live attenuated vaccines within 1 month
  prior to the scheduled BNCT.
- Exclude - 9. Patients received major surgery within 1 month prior to the scheduled
  BNCT or are still recovering from a previous surgery. The investigator will evaluate
  the subject's condition when the subject receives major surgery. Major surgery is
  defined as procedure that requires general anaesthesia and/or anticipated hospitalization
  longer than 24 hours, with significant risk of blood loss or complications. Examples
  include heart surgery, organ transplants, and prolonged operations such as certain
  back surgeries. Procedures such as stent implantation, biopsy, endoscopy, and day
  surgery are excluded.
- Exclude - 10. Patients who had radiation myelitits or radiation necrosis of the
  brain/brain stem.
- Exclude - 11. Patient who is prone to vascular rupture during the trial as assessed
  by the investigator. The Patient will be eligible for the study if they have undergone
  stent implantation and obtained consent from the investigator.
- Exclude - 12. Patients with severe congestive heart failure or renal failure, as
  well as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or poorly controlled arrhythmia
  within 6 months prior to the scheduled BNCT.
- Exclude - 13. Severe comorbidities, including but not limited to poorly controlled
  epilepsy, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled hypertension; chronic
  lung diseases (e.g., obstructive pneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis,
  and severe emphysema); kidney diseases (e.g., chronic renal failure, acute renal
  failure and nephrotic syndrome); cardiac diseases (e.g., New York Heart Association
  \[NYHA\] Functional Classification Class III or IV); phenylketonuria; and/or other
  severe conditions in the opinion of the investigator.
- Exclude - 14. Suspected or known hypersensitivity (including allergy) to boron or
  any component of the study drug or contrast media.
- Exclude - 15. Subject with hereditary fructose intolerance.
- Exclude - 16. With a cardiac pacemaker or will interfere with MRI-based or CT-based
  dose-planning or tumor response evaluation.
- Exclude - 17. Restless subjects who are unable to lie or sit in a cast for more
  than 30 minutes.
- Exclude - 18. Any medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the
  investigator, may interfere with optimal participation in the study or place the
  subject at increased risk of adverse events (AEs).
- Exclude - 19. Female subject who is planning to be pregnant or lactating during
  the study period.
- Exclude - 20. Subject who is considered unfit to participate in the clinical study
  as assessed by the investigator.

summary: This Phase I/II study, titled 'A Phase I/II Study to Evaluate Safety and
  Efficacy of the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) using B10 L-BPA as Boron Carrier
  in Malignant Brain Tumors.', aims to assess the efficacy of B10 L-BPA with BNCT
  in patients with malignant brain tumors. The primary objective is to evaluate the
  safety and efficacy of BNCT with B10 L-BPA for malignant brain tumors treatment,
  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)
  as the standard for assessment.
