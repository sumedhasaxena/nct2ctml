summary: 'Objectives: To characterize safety, tolerability, MTD and OBD of intratumoral
  injection of SGN1 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to preliminarily investigate
  the efficacy and safety of SGN1 in specific tumor subtypes.


  Study Rationale: The mechanism of action for SGN1 is based on the fact that most
  tumors are methionine dependent. SGN1 is designed to be used as a tumor therapeutic
  bacterium that can preferentially replicate and accumulate in tumors and starve
  them of essential amino acids by delivering the oncolytic enzyme L-Methioninase.


  Patient Population: Patients presenting with histologically confirmed advanced and/or
  metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy and for which no
  other conventional therapy exists.'
