prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Adults \u226518 years of age or the minimum legal adult age (whichever is greater)\
  \ on the day of signing the ICF (no upper limit of age)."
- 2. Newly diagnosed, morphologically documented primary AML or AML secondary to myelodysplastic
  syndrome or a myeloproliferative neoplasm based on the World Health Organization
  (WHO) 2008/2016 classification.
- "3. Participant has confirmed FLT3-ITD-positive (\u22650.05 SR or \u22655% VAF)\
  \ activating mutation from initial diagnosis in bone marrow or peripheral blood\
  \ as determined by a local institution's validated molecular testing."
- 4. Participants must have confirmed, morphologically documented CR1, on the most
  recent BMA, based on the local laboratory results, performed within 28 days prior
  to C1D1 of maintenance therapy. Complete remission will be defined as \<5% blasts
  in the bone marrow with no morphologic characteristics of acute leukemia (e.g.,
  Auer Rods), no evidence of extramedullary disease, and no leukemic blasts in the
  peripheral blood.
- "Complete blood count recovery is required with absolute neutrophil count of more\
  \ than 1.000 \xD7 109/L and platelets more than 100 \xD7 109/L (IWG criteria).27"
- '5. Participant must meet the following prior therapy requirements:'
- '1. Has received at least one cycle of induction therapy but no more than two to
  achieve CR1. The induction cycles can be the same regimen or different regimens
  and may contain conventional agents only (e.g., cytarabine + daunorubicin or idarubicin:
  "7 + 3" or "5 + 2"), or a combination with FLT3 inhibitors.'
- 2. Has not received more than four cycles of consolidation therapy. Regimens may
  contain conventional agents only.
- 3. FLT3 inhibitors are permitted as part of the induction or consolidation treatment.
- Participants who received FLT3 inhibitors before enrollment in the trial will need
  a washout period of 14 days.
- 6. Able to begin the maintenance phase within 60 days of D1 of the last consolidation
  cycle received.
- 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 2.
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), French-American-British
  classification M3 or WHO classification of APL with translocation, t(15;17)(q22;q12),
  or BCR-ABL positive leukemia (i.e., chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis);
  participants who undergo diagnostic workup for APL and treatment with all-trans
  retinoic acid (ATRA), but who are found not to have APL, are eligible (treatment
  with ATRA must be discontinued before starting induction chemotherapy).
- Exclude - 2. Diagnosis of AML secondary to prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for
  other neoplasms.
- 'Exclude - 3. Prior treatment for AML, except for the following allowances:'
- 'Exclude - 1. Induction and consolidation therapy, as previously described (inclusion
  criterion #5)'
- Exclude - 2. Leukapheresis
- Exclude - 3. Hydroxyurea to treat hyperleukocytosis
- Exclude - 4. Cranial radiotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) leukostasis
- Exclude - 5. Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy
- Exclude - 6. Growth factor/cytokine support
- Exclude - 4. Participant had received allo-HSCT as part of AML treatment.
- Exclude - 5. Treatment with any strong or moderate CYP3A inducers within 2 weeks
  or 5 half-lives of randomization whichever is longer
- 'Exclude - 6. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including the
  following:'
- Exclude - 1. QTcF interval \>450 ms (based on average of triplicate ECG at Screening)
- Exclude - 2. Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome or known family
  history of congenital long QT syndrome
- Exclude - 3. History of clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular
  tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsade de Pointes
- Exclude - 4. Participant has bradycardia of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm;
  as determined by central reading), unless the participant has a pacemaker
- Exclude - 5. History of second- or third-degree heart block. Candidates with a history
  of heart block may be eligible if they currently have pacemakers and have no history
  of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmia with pacemakers.
- Exclude - 6. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening
- Exclude - 7. Uncontrolled angina pectoris within 6 months prior to screening
- Exclude - 8. New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure
- "Exclude - 9. LVEF \u226445% or institutional lower limit of normal"
- Exclude - 10. Uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure \>180 mmHg
  or diastolic blood pressure \>110 mmHg despite optimal medical management)
- Exclude - 11. Complete left or right bundle branch block
- Exclude - 12. Severe aortic stenosis

summary: This clinical two-arm trial is designed to evaluate two doses of quizartinib
  as maintenance therapy after induction/consolidation in participants with FMS-like
  tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (+) acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) in first complete remission (CR) who have not received allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
