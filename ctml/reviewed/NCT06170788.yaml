summary: 'The primary objective of the study is to compare sacituzumab tirumotecan
  combined with pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab alone with respect to overall survival
  (OS). The primary hypothesis is that the combination of sacituzumab tirumotecan
  and pembrolizumab is superior to pembrolizumab alone with respect to OS.


  All participants who have completed the first course of pembrolizumab may be eligible
  for up to an additional 9 cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy if there is blinded
  independent central review (BICR)-verified progressive disease by Response Evaluation
  Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) after initial treatment.'

        every 6 weeks (q6w) via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 6-week cycle for 18 cycles.
        Additionally, participants receive diphenhydramine (or equivalent), an H2

        of sacituzumab tirumotecan. At subsequent infusions, the H2 antagonist and
        dexamethasone are optional, at the discretion of the investigator.
