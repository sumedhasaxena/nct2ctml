summary: '"This is a randomized phase II, two-arm, open label, clinical trial to identify
  LP-WGS ctDNA biomarker to predict T-DXd response in low-HER2 expressing advanced
  breast cancer patients compared with endocrine therapy. The hormone receptor (HR)-positive
  low-HER2 advanced breast cancer patients (HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ \& ISH negative, n=141)
  who progressed on 1st line endocrine + CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and received no
  other systemic therapy for advanced disease are enrolled in this study. Patients
  are 2:1 randomized to receive T-DXd (5.4mg/kg every 3 weeks, n=94) or endocrine
  therapy of physician''s choice (TPC: fulvestrant, fulvestrant + alpelisib, Fulvestrant
  + Capivasertib, exemestane, exemestane + everolimus, or tamoxifen, n=47, fulvestrant
  + alpelisib can be selected in PIK3CA activating mutation positive patients, Fulvestrant
  + Capivasertib can be selected in 1 or More mutation positive of PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN).
  The mandatory baseline archival tissue and ctDNA collection followed by on-treatment
  ctDNA collection (Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 6) and ctDNA collection at progression
  will be performed in this study.


  The primary endpoint is PFS after randomization in two treatment arms. The secondary
  endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression-free
  survival (PFS2), adverse events by CTCAE 5.0 criteria, and Quality of life (QoL)
  measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-BR23 evaluated by questionnaire. The exploratory
  endpoints are to identify ctDNA biomarkers to predict the TDxd treatment outcome
  (PFS, OS, ORR) compared to endocrine therapy in HER2-low advanced breast cancer
  patients and to assess the accordance of genomic profiles between ctDNA and tumor
  tissues. Predictive biomarkers include copy number aberration (CNA) of gene loci,
  total ctDNA CNA burden, mutations, ctDNA-based molecular subtype, or HER2 amplicon
  copy number on LP-WGS ctDNA analysis. The investigator believe this trial will identify
  crucial circulating biomarkers for T-DXd treatment response in low-HER2 patients,
  which can guide right patient selection and potential molecular target identification
  to maximize T-DXd response and to overcome T-DXd resistance.'
