prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
  small cell features.'
- '* Metastatic disease in bone documented on bone scan, or in soft tissue documented
  on CT/MRI scan.'
- '* Progressive disease in the setting of surgical or medical castration with evidence
  of disease progression on treatment with abiraterone acetate in the mCSPC setting
  or first line mCRPC setting is required.'
- '* Eastern Cooperate Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 2, with life expectancy
  of at least 6 months as assessed by the investigator.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Any medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past
  year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may make
  the participant inappropriate for the study.
- Exclude - * Know history of active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, chronic
  diarrhea, or previous gastric resection or lap-band surgery.
- Exclude - * Clinically significant cardiovascular disease.
- Exclude - * Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease
  or clinically significant history of seizure.
- 'Exclude - * Prior treatment for prostate cancer at any stage with any cytotoxic
  chemotherapy, radioligand therapy (i.e. 177Lu-PSMA-617, radium 223), androgen receptor
  signaling inhibitors (ARSi) including enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, poly
  ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) monotherapy or other systemic anti-cancer treatment,
  with the following exceptions:'
- Exclude - 1. Treatment with first-generation antiandrogen agents, if discontinued
  prior to first dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - 2. Docetaxel treatment is allowed for mCSPC, as long as no signs of failure,
  or disease progression occurred during treatment or within 3 months of treatment
  completion.
- Exclude - * Previous administration with an investigational product within 30 days
  or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study intervention (whichever is shorter).
- Exclude - * Inadequate organ function.

summary: 'Pfizer MEVPRO-1 (C2321014) is a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical
  trial evaluating whether combining the study medicine (PF-06821497) with enzalutamide
  is safe and effective compared to physician''s choice of either second-line androgen
  receptor (AR) directed therapy with enzalutamide or docetaxel (chemotherapy) for
  treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after progression
  on prior abiraterone acetate treatment.


  The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the radiographic progression
  free survival (rPFS) of the combination of PF-06821497 plus enzalutamide versus
  physician''s choice of enzalutamide or docetaxel.'
