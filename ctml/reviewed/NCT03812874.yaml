  years of age)'
- 9. Anticipated life expectancy of \>= 6 months at assessment during screening.
- 10. Ability to understand and have signed a written informed consent document.

- Exclude - 1. 1\. Patient with Child-Pugh B8-9.
- Exclude - 2. Patient who has had anti-cancer therapy including surgery, radiotherapy,
  immunotherapy, or chemotherapy (except in TACE regimen) within 4 weeks prior to
  the screening visit.
- Exclude - 3. Patient who has received any other investigational agents within 4
  weeks prior to the screening visit.
- Exclude - 4. Patient who has not recovered from the side effects of the earlier
  investigational agent or had anti-cancer therapy including surgery, radiotherapy,
  immunotherapy, or chemotherapy.
- Exclude - 5. Patient with known brain metastases, leptomeningeal or epidural metastases
  (unless treated and well controlled for \>= 3 months).
- Exclude - 6. Patient with prior history of co-malignancies, except for adequately
  treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the
  breast, and basal cell/squamous cell skin cancer.

  dysfunction, or unstable arrhythmia or symptomatic peripheral arterial vascular
  disease.
- Exclude - 8. Patient with history of positive serology for human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV).

  which require systemic therapy.
- Exclude - 10. Patient with poor liver function as indicated by serum bilirubin \>
  2 mg/dL, Child-Pugh Class C, severe coagulopathy (INR \> 2) not correctable with
  vitamin K, or active hepatic encephalopathy.
- Exclude - 11. Patient with known allergic reactions to biological agent or polypeptides
  similar to PTX-9908 Injection.
- Exclude - 12. Woman who is pregnant or nursing.
- Exclude - 13. Patient with concomitant disease or condition that could interfere
  with the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
  pose an unacceptable risk to the patient in this study.
- Exclude - 14. Patient with unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol
  for any reason.
- Exclude - 15. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated
  demonstration of a QTc interval \>480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using Frederica's
  QT correction formula
- Exclude - 16. A history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g.,
  heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)
- Exclude - 17. The use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval

summary: 'This is a multicenter, Phase I/II study in patients with non-resectable
  hepatocellular carcinoma following TACE treatment.


  Phase I (Open-label dose escalation)


  This study will be an open-label study with an Accelerated Phase and a Standard
  Phase. For the Accelerated Phase of the study, one patient per dose level (1 mg/kg,
  and 2 mg/kg) is planned. For the dose levels in the standard phase (4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg
  and 16 mg/kg), it will follow the Fibonacci''s rule of 3 + 3 design. All eligible
  patients who have received TACE treatment and recovered well, will be administrated
  PTX-9908 Injection intravenously one dose per day for 5 days on Week 1 (excludes
  weekends and public holidays), and one dose per week (on Day 8, Day 15, and Day
  22) for 3 consecutive weeks. The 4-week treatment period, will be followed by a
  2-week follow-up period.


  Phase II (Randomized placebo controlled dose expansion)


  The objective of phase II is to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor
  activity of PTX-9908 Injection for patients with non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma
  following TACE treatment. Approximately 24 eligible patients who have received TACE
  treatment and recovered, will be randomized to PTX-9908 Injection using the predetermined
  dose in phase I or the vehicle placebo in a 2:1 ratio. PTX-9908 Injection or placebo
  will be administered intravenously one dose per day for 5 days in Week 1 (excludes
  weekends and public holidays), and one dose per week till Week 12 (Day 78). The
  12-week treatment period, will be followed by a 2-week follow-up period.'
