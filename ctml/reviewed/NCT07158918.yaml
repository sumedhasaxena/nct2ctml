- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Subject must understand and be willing to provide informed consent and be able
  to comply with the study procedures and restrictions.'
- "* Subjects must be \u226518 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent\
  \ form (ICF)."
- '* Subject must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced
  unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.'
- '* Subject must be relapsed or be refractory to available standard therapy or they
  must be intolerant of available standard therapy.'
- '* Subject must meet Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
  0 or 1 assessed 7 days before the first administration of the study drug.'
- '* Subjects must be recovered from AEs from prior therapy to Grade 1 or the baseline
  grade more than 14 days prior to the first administration of the study drug, except
  alopecia or Grade 2 toxicities that are deemed stable or irreversible (e.g., peripheral
  neuropathy)'
- "* Subjects who have AEs due to previous anticancer therapies must have recovered\
  \ to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Subject with endocrine-related AEs who are adequately\
  \ treated with hormone replacement or subjects who have \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy\
  \ are eligible."
- '* Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic, and thyroid function
  at screening and within 7 days prior to the first administration of study drug.'
- '* Female subjects who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal must agree to
  use a highly effective method of birth control (2 methods strongly recommended)
  during the study and for 6 months following the last dose of ABL103/pembrolizumab.'
- '* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
  test at screening and within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).'
- '* Male subjects with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to
  use contraception and and must not donate sperm during the treatment period with
  ABL103 and taxane and for at least 6 months after the final administration of ABL103
  and taxane.'
- '* Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner(s) must agree to remain
  abstinent or use a condom throughout the study period, and for at least 6 months
  after the final administration of ABL103 and taxane, and during the partner''s pregnancy
  or breastfeeding period. When using a male condom, the partner must also use an
  additional method of contraception acceptable for female subjects.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Subject has received prior anticancer monoclonal antibody treatment
  or investigational therapy (agent or device) for which the pharmacologic or toxicity
  profile is not expected to have resolved prior to the first administration of the
  study drug. A minimum of 28 days is generally recommended for agents with known
  delayed toxicities or prolonged biological activity, unless otherwise justified.
- Exclude - * Subject has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first
  administration of study drug, or has radiation-related toxicities, requiring corticosteroids.
- Exclude - * Subject has received any prior immunotherapy and was discontinued from
  the treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE (except endocrine disorders that can
  be treated with replacement therapy) or was discontinued from that treatment due
  to Grade 2 myocarditis or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
- Exclude - * Subject has received radiation therapy to the lung that is \>30 Gy within
  6 months of the first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Subject has risk factors for bowel obstruction or bowel perforation,
  including, but not limited to a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal
  abscess, and abdominal carcinomatosis. Subjects with ovarian cancer with a history
  of abdominal carcinomatosis can be enrolled.
