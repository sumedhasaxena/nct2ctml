summary: 'Phase 1/2, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the
  safety and tolerability of zidesamtinib (NVL-520), determine the recommended phase
  2 dose (RP2D), and evaluate the antitumor activity in patients with advanced ROS1-positive
  (ROS1+) NSCLC and other advanced ROS1-positive solid tumors.


  Phase 1 will determine the RP2D and, if applicable, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
  of zidesamtinib in patients with advanced ROS1-positive solid tumors.


  Phase 2 will determine the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Blinded
  Independent Central Review (BICR) of zidesamtinib at the RP2D. Secondary objectives
  will include the duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR), progression-free
  survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of zidesamtinib
  in patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors.'
