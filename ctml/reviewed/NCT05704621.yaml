prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Patients with first recurrence of platinum sensitive, invasive epithelial ovarian-,
  fallopian tube- or primary peritoneal cancer of any initial stage.'
- '* Progression-free interval of at least 6 months after end of last platinum- containing
  therapy,'
- '* Progressed during PARP inhibitor maintenance'
- "* Women aged \u2265 18 years"
- '* Complete resection of the tumor seems possible (estimated by an experienced surgeon).
  Intra-abdominal disease has to be excluded by MRI/CT, if other surgical approaches
  for isolated extra-abdominal recurrences are planned'
- 1. A positive AGO-score or iMODEL+PET/CT
- 2. Patients who are likely to be completely resected according to the investigator's
  judgment will be allowed by consensus between PI(surgeon) and designated radiologist
  even if AGO or iMODEL+PET/CT negative.
- '* Patients who have given their signed and written informed consent and their consent
  to data transmission and -processing.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Patients with non-epithelial tumors as well as borderline tumors.
- Exclude - * Patients without recurrence who are scheduled for diagnostic/second-look
  surgery or debulking surgery after completion of chemotherapy
- Exclude - * More than one prior chemotherapy
- Exclude - * Patients with second, third, or later recurrence
- Exclude - * Patients with second malignancies who have been treated by laparotomy,
  as well as other neoplasms, if the treatment might interfere with the treatment
  of relapsed ovarian cancer or if major impact on prognosis is expected.
- Exclude - * Patients with so-called platinum-refractory tumor, i.e. progression
  during chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months after end of former first platinum-
  containing therapy
- Exclude - * Only palliative surgery planned
- Exclude - * Radiological signs suggesting metastases not accessible to surgical
  removal (i.e. complete resection is deemed impossible)
- Exclude - * Any concomitant disease not allowing surgery and/or chemotherapy
- Exclude - * Any medical history indicating excessive peri-operative risk
- 'Exclude - * Any current medication inducing considerable surgical risk (e.g. bleeding:
  due to oral anticoagulating agents, bevacizumab)'
- Exclude - * No assessable archival tumor tissue
