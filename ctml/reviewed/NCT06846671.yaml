summary: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BGB-16673
  compared with investigator's choice (idelalisib plus rituximab \[for CLL only\]
  or bendamustine plus rituximab or venetoclax plus rituximab retreatment) in participants
  with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) previously
  exposed to both BTK inhibitors (BTKi) and BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i).
