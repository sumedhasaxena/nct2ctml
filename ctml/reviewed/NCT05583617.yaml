summary: CO43923 is a platform study that will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and
  pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple treatment combinations, as monotherapy or in combination,
  in participants with multiple myeloma (MM). The study is designed with the flexibility
  to open new treatment substudies as new treatments become available. Information
  regarding the opened substudies are found below.

        and a target dose of cevostamab. The step-up dose will be given on Day(D)1

        will be administered on D1 and D15 for cycles 1-6 and D1 of cycle 7 onwards.
        Each cycle is 28 days. Lenalidomide will be administered by mouth (PO) on

        the same dosing schedule as the dose escalation phase. The target dose will
        be determined after the escalation phase. Lenalidomide will be administered
        PO on a 28-day cycle.
