summary: 'DESTINY-Gastric03 will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
  immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)
  alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy in HER2-expressing
  advanced/metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and esophageal adenocarcinoma
  patients.


  Study hypotheses: Combination of T-DXd with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy
  administered to subjects at the recommended phase 2 dose will show manageable safety
  and tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy so as to permit further clinical
  testing. T-DXd in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitor
  administered to HER2-expressing gastric, GEJ and esophageal cancer patients who
  have not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic disease will show preliminary
  evidence of anti-tumour activity and the potential to become a therapeutic option
  for this patient population.'
