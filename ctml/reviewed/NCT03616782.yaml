prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Male or female patients aged \u226519 years"
- '2. Histologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) meeting the following criteria:
  determined by histology and either expression of cyclin D1 (in association with
  CD20 and CD5) or evidence of t(11;14) translocation (by cytogenetics, fluorescence
  in-situ hybridization, or polymerase chain reaction)'
- 3. In all patients, a paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue block or slides (preferably
  of lymph node origin or bone marrow) was sent to central laboratories (Diagnostic
  Cytology Laboratories or department of pathology) for confirmation of diagnosis
  of MCL.
- 4. Stage II, III, or IV
- 5. Patients who received RCHOP or VR-CAP induction chemotherapy for 6 cycles confirmed
  response as more than PR or PR after induction therapy and who are ineligible for
  transplantation. .
- 6. No clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma
- 7. Patients must have measurable disease; CT scans at baseline are required to define
  the extent of measurable disease; the scans must be obtained within 6 weeks prior
  to registration; combined CT/PET scans may be used for the baseline and subsequent
  evaluations if accurate tumor measurements can be obtained from the CT component
- 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2
- 9. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1,000 mm\^3 (unless low count due to marrow
  involvement or splenomegaly)
- 10. Platelets \> 75,000 mm\^3 (unless low counts due to marrow involvement or splenomegaly)
- "11. Creatinine clearance of \u2265 30 mL/min"
- "12. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (may be up to 3.0 mg/dL\
  \ if due to Gilbert's disease or due to liver involvement by lymphoma), alanine\
  \ transaminase level \u22643 times the upper limit of normal; aspartate transaminase\
  \ level \u22643 times the upper limit of normal"
- 13. Patients over the age of 45 must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
  of greater than 45% documented within 90 days prior to registration
- "14. Female patients had to be post-menopausal for \u22651 year, surgically sterile,\
  \ or practicing an effective method of birth control (as described in the protocol),\
  \ and have a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin or urine pregnancy\
  \ test at screening; they also had to agree to continue using birth control measures\
  \ for \u22656 months after terminating treatment. Male patients had to agree to\
  \ use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy
  test during the screening period.
- Exclude - 2. Grade 2 or higher baseline peripheral neuropathy
- Exclude - 3. Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.
- Exclude - 4. Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field
  is small, 7 days will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and
  administration of the ixazomib.
- Exclude - 5. Central nervous system involvement.
- Exclude - 6. Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection
  within 14 days before study enrollment.
- Exclude - 7. Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including
  uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive
  heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.
- Exclude - 8. Systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of ixazomib,
  with strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
  phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort.
- Exclude - 9. Active systemic infection requiring treatment, a known diagnosis of
  human HIV, or active hepatitis B (hepatitis B carriers were permitted)
- Exclude - 10. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's
  opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this
  protocol.
- Exclude - 11. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or
  excipients in the various formulations of any agent.
- Exclude - 12. Known gastrointestinal(GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere
  with the oral absorption or tolerance of ixazomib including difficulty swallowing.
- Exclude - 13. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before
  study enrollment or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence
  of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
  of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.
- Exclude - 14. Patient has more than Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination
  during the screening period.
- Exclude - 15. Participation in other clinical trials, including those with other
  investigational agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of
  this trial and throughout the duration of this trial.
- Exclude - 16. Patients that have previously been treated with ixazomib, or participated
  in a study with ixazomib whether treated with ixazomib or not.

summary: "1. Induction chemotherapy 1) RCHOP(Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Vincristine+Prednisone)\
  \ 2) VR-CAP (Bortezomib+Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Prednisone)\n\n \
  \  Patients who have received induction chemotherapy will be evaluated for responses\
  \ and those who achieved more than PR(Partial response) or PR will be eligible for\
  \ this study after receiving informed consents.\n2. Experimental step Maintenance\
  \ ixazomib beginning at least 8 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy,\
  \ patients receive ixazomib per oral 3 mg on day 1, 8, and 15 for 4 weeks. And the\
  \ dose of ixazomib can be escalated to 4mg by response such as partial response\
  \ or MRD positive. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence\
  \ of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are screened and\
  \ sign the informed consent after completion induction chemotherapy (RCHOP or VR-CAP)\
  \ with more than PR or PR confirmed. It is likely to take approximately 8 weeks\
  \ in performing above procedures.\n\nPatients start maintenance therapy at least\
  \ 8 weeks and also can be allowed for the extension of 4 weeks because of delayed\
  \ response evaluation, recovery toxicities of chemotherapy, and official process\
  \ including agree with informed consent. Recently, ongoing studies about maintenance\
  \ therapy in lymphoma have window periods of 8-12 weeks.\n\nIxazomib maintenance\
  \ should continue for 2 years."
