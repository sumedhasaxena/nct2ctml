- '* Has one of the following histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid
  tumors: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or Hepatoblastoma'
- '* Has progressed after at least 1 prior systemic treatment for RMS or hepatoblastoma
  and who has no satisfactory alternative treatment option (ie, is ineligible for

  if HCV viral load is undetectable'
- 'The main exclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:'
- '* Has a history of (noninfectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
  that required steroids or has current ILD/pneumonitis, and/or suspected ILD/pneumonitis

- '* Has a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant'
- '* Has clinically significant corneal disease'
- '* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
  meningitis/leptomeningeal disease; participants with previously treated brain metastases
  may participate provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of
  progression) for at least 4 weeks'
- '* Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disorder'
- '* Has a history of clinically significant congenital cardiac syndrome'
- '* Has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection'
- '* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active
  treatment within the past 1 year'
- '* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy'
- '* Has concurrent active hepatitis B (HBsAg positive and/or detectable HBV deoxyribonucleic
  acid \[DNA\]) and HCV defined as anti-HCV antibody (Ab) positive and detectable
  HCV ribonucleic acid \[RNA\]) infection'

summary: 'Researchers are looking for new ways to treat children with hepatoblastoma
  or rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that has relapsed or is refractory:


  * Hepatoblastoma is a common liver cancer in babies and very young children

  * RMS is a cancer that starts in muscle cells, often in a child''s head and neck,
  bladder, arms, or legs

  * Relapsed means the cancer came back after treatment

  * Refractory means the cancer did not respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment


  The study treatment HER3-DXd (also known as MK-1022 or patritumab deruxtecan) is
  an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and
  delivers treatment to destroy those cells. The goals of this study are to learn:


  * About the safety of HER3-DXd in children and if they tolerate it

  * What happens to HER3-DXd in children''s bodies over time

  * If children who receive HER3-DXd have the cancer get smaller or go away'
