- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) and 1b (Dose Expansion): Participants with histologically
  or cytologically confirmed advanced, metastatic, or unresectable solid tumors associated
  with dependency on CDK4, including HR+ breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial
  cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.'
- '* Phase 1a: Received prior therapy for their condition (if available) and should
  be refractory to, or intolerant of standard-of-care therapies. In regions where
  approved and available, participants with HR+ breast cancer must have received at
  least 2 prior lines of treatment including endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
  For combination with elacestrant, participants must have received at least 1 prior
  line of treatment for advanced/metastatic disease including prior endocrine therapy
  and CDK4/6 inhibitor in either the adjuvant or advanced/metastatic setting.'
- '* Phase 1b: Selected tumor cohorts will include HR+/HER2- breast cancer and additional
  tumor types.'
- '* Phase 1b: Participants with HR+/HER2- breast cancer enrolled in regions where
  CDK4/6 inhibitors are approved and available must have received at least one line
  of therapy for advanced disease including endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
  Participants can have received up to 2 lines of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for
  advanced disease.'
- "* Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status \u2264 1."
- '* Female participants with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer must be postmenopausal
  or receiving ovarian function suppression treatment.'
- '* Adequate organ function without symptomatic visceral disease.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Prior therapy selectively targeting CDK4 (prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy
  is permitted and required in local regions where it is approved and available).
- Exclude - * Known leptomeningeal disease or uncontrolled, untreated brain metastases.
- "Exclude - * Any malignancy \u2264 3 years before the first dose of study treatment(s)\
  \ except for the specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally\
  \ recurring cancer that has been treated with curative intent (eg, resected basal\
  \ or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ\
  \ of the cervix or breast)."
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled diabetes.
- "Exclude - * Infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral\
  \ therapy \u2264 28 days before the first dose of study drug(s), or symptomatic\
  \ COVID-19 infection."
- "Exclude - * Participants with untreated chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis\
  \ B virus (HBV) carriers with HBV DNA \u2265 500 IU/mL (or \u2265 2500 copies/mL)\
  \ at screening."
- Exclude - * Participants with active hepatitis C infection.
- Exclude - * Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or organ transplantation.

summary: This is a dose escalation and dose expansion study to compare how well BGB-43395,
  a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor, works as monotherapy or
  in combination with fulvestrant, letrozole, or elacestrant in participants with
  hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-)
  breast cancer (BC) and other advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of this study
  is to explore the recommended dosing for BGB-43395.
