summary: This is a Phase1 study to assess the safety, PK, PD and efficacy of HM97662,
  EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, in solid tumors. The study is comprised of Dose-Escalation
  Part followed by randomized Dose-Ranging Part and Dose-Expansion Part. Dose-Escalation
  Part is planned with a 3+3 Dose-Escalation design and is to establish the MTD or
  RD for randomized Dose-Ranging Part. Dose-Ranging Part is designed mainly to further
  evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of HM97662 monotherapy in subjects with
  specific genomic alterations to more precisely determine the potential RP2D that
  are to be tested in a Dose-Expansion Part. Dose-Expansion Part is designed to assess
  the potential efficacy of HM97662 monotherapy when administered at the RP2D to subjects
  in indication-specific expansion cohorts.
