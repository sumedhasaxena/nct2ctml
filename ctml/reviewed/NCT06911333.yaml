summary: 'The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability
  of AD1208 to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) or maximumly administered
  dose(MAD) in any progressive, locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid
  tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:


  * Which dosage of AD1208 is safe and tolerable for participants?

  * What medical problems do participants have when taking AD1208?


  Participants will:


  * Take drug AD1208 every day up to 1 cycle at the least.

  * Visit the site once every 1 weeks for checkups and tests during cycle 1 and every
  3 weeks from cycle 2 onwards.

  * Keep a diary of any adverse events and administrated drug'
