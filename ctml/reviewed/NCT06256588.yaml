prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following
  criteria apply:'
- '* Has newly diagnosed unresected Locally Advanced (LA) histologically confirmed
  HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx and completed cisplatin
  plus radiotherapy (termed "CRT" in this protocol) with curative intent and has no
  evidence of distant metastatic disease.'
- '* Has provided acceptable core or excisional biopsy obtained prior to CRT:'
- '* PD-L1 positive tumor status'
- '* If the primary tumor site is oropharyngeal carcinoma, the participant must have
  p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing.'
- '* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1'
- '* Has adequate organ function.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria
  apply:'
- Exclude - * Has received prior radiation therapy (RT), systemic therapy, targeted
  therapy, or surgery for management of head and neck cancer not considered part of
  CRT. Participants receiving induction chemotherapy are excluded. CRT combinations
  with components other than cisplatin and RT (e.g., experimental agents, including
  radiosensitizers/radioprotectants, cetuximab) are not eligible.
- Exclude - * Has cancer outside of the oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx or oral cavity,
  such as nasopharyngeal, sinus, other para-nasal, or other unknown primary head and
  neck cancer. Has more than one primary HNSCC tumor.
- "Exclude - * Has experienced any of the following with prior immunotherapy: any\
  \ immune-related adverse event (irAE) of Grade \u22653, immune-related severe neurologic\
  \ events of any grade (e.g., myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, encephalitis,\
  \ Guillain-Barr\xE9 Syndrome, or transverse myelitis), exfoliative dermatitis of\
  \ any grade (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or Drug Rash\
  \ with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms \\[DRESS\\] syndrome), or myocarditis\
  \ of any grade. Non-clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are not exclusionary."
- Exclude - * Has undergone any major surgical procedure or experienced significant
  traumatic injury that has not resolved by the time of randomization.
- Exclude - * Has any history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (past or
  current).
- Exclude - * Has cirrhosis of any stage or current unstable liver biliary disease
  per investigator assessment defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
  coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal/gastric varices, or persistent jaundice.
- Exclude - * Has a history or current evidence of any medical condition, therapy,
  or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results, interfere with
  their participation for the full duration of the study intervention, or indicate
  it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion
  of the investigator.
- Exclude - * Is receiving any other anticancer or experimental therapy. No other
  experimental therapies (including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal
  treatment, antibody therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, or other
  experimental drugs) of any kind are permitted while the participant is receiving
  study intervention.
- Exclude - * Previous treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or
  an agent directed to another stimulatory or coinhibitory T-cell receptor \[e.g.,
  Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4), OX-40, CD137\]
- Exclude - * Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within
  the projected duration of the study, starting with the Screening Visit through 120
  days after the last dose of study intervention.
- Exclude - * Has a history of severe allergic and/or anaphylactic reactions to chimeric,
  human or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or known allergies to dostarlimab
  or its excipients.
