summary: "TransCon IL-2 \u03B2/\u03B3 is an investigational drug being developed for\
  \ treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This is a first-in-human,\
  \ open-label, Phase 1/2, dose escalation and dose expansion study of TransCon IL-2\
  \ \u03B2/\u03B3 as monotherapy or in combination therapy in adult participants with\
  \ advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Given the unique PK profile enabled by the\
  \ TransCon technology, TransCon IL-2 \u03B2/\u03B3 presents the opportunity to enhance\
  \ the therapeutic index of current IL-2 therapy."
