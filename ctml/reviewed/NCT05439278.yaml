summary: In newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients aged 70 years or older who are suitable
  for concurrent temozolomide, the optimal dose of radiation therapy is controversial
  . The purpose of this study is to compare conventional radiotherapy of 60 Gy (6
  weeks) versus hypofractionated radiotherapy of 40 Gy (3 weeks) in terms of overall
  survival as the primary endpoint along with progression-free survival, toxicity,
  quality of life, and prognostic biomarkers.
