prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed r/m squamous cell carcinoma of the
  oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx that is considered incurable by
  local therapies.'
- '* No prior systemic therapy for r/m HNSCC. Individuals who had disease progression
  or recurrence more than 6 months after the last dose of curative intent systemic
  platinum-containing therapy for locoregionally advanced disease are eligible.'
- '* At least 1 measurable lesion by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
  that qualifies as a RECIST v1.1 target lesion at baseline.'
- '* Have adequate tumor tissue samples preferably from lesions not irradiated prior
  to biopsy (acceptable from irradiated lesions if disease progression has been demonstrated
  in such lesions) to submit for central testing.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.'
- '* Known results from human papillomavirus (HPV) status test (p16 expression) for
  oropharyngeal carcinoma defined as p16 testing.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Individuals with nasopharyngeal cancer (any histology), squamous cell
  carcinoma of unknown primary tumors, skin (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), paranasal
  sinuses, and salivary gland.
- Exclude - * Have disease that is suitable for any local therapies with curative
  intent.
- Exclude - * Individuals who had disease progression or recurrence within 6 months
  after the last dose of curative intent systemic platinum-containing therapy for
  locoregionally advanced disease.
- Exclude - * Have a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease
  that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.
- Exclude - * Have an active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in
  the past 2 years. (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or
  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
  corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not
  considered a form of systemic treatment.
- 'Exclude - * Prior treatment with any of the following within the specific time
  frame prior to the first dose of study drug:'
- Exclude - * Major surgery for any cause or significant traumatic injury within 4
  weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Individuals must have recovered adequately
  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study
  drug.
- Exclude - * Any noninvestigational anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy,
  targeted therapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy, etc) within 4 weeks prior to
  the first dose of study drug. Concurrent use for noncancer related condition (eg,
  hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.
- Exclude - * Any investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within
  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug.
- "Exclude - * Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\
  \ Individuals must have recovered to Grade \u2264 1 from all radiation-related toxicities,\
  \ not requiring corticosteroid, and have not experienced radiation pneumonitis."
- Exclude - * Received prior treatment with any anti-PD-1/PD-L1, anti-TIGIT, or other
  immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- Exclude - * Currently receiving chronic systemic steroids (\> 10 mg/day prednisone
  or its equivalent). Use of topical, inhalational, intranasal, intraocular steroids,
  and use as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, IV contrast allergy)
  are permitted.
- "Exclude - * Any unresolved toxicity (Grade \u2265 2) per National Cancer Institute\
  \ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 from prior anticancer therapy\
  \ or surgical intervention, with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory\
  \ toxicities if the laboratory thresholds defined in the inclusion criteria are\
  \ met. Individuals with Grade \u2264 2 neuropathy are eligible for this study."
- Exclude - * Have an active second malignancy or have had an active second malignancy
  within 3 years prior to enrollment.
- Exclude - * Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Individuals
  with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable
  CNS disease for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and all neurologic symptoms
  have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastasis
  and are not requiring use of steroid for at least 14 days prior to the first dose
  of study drugs.
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'Master protocol: The main goal of this master clinical study is to evaluate
  the efficacy and safety of multiple novel combination therapies in participants
  with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in various substudies.


  Substudy-01 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel combination of treatment
  regimens, domvanalimab (DOM) and zimberelimab (ZIM) combined with chemotherapy vs
  ZIM combined with chemotherapy.


  The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of DOM and ZIM in combination with
  chemotherapy versus ZIM in combination with chemotherapy.'
