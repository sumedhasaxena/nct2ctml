prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Patients must sign the written pre-screening informed consent form (ICF) before
  any pre-screening procedures.'
- '* Patients who present histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic HPV16+
  HNSCC that is considered incurable by local therapies.'
- "* Patients who have a tumor that expresses PD-L1 \\[CPS \u22651\\] as determined\
  \ by the European Conformity (CE)-marked/Food and Drug Administration-approved CDx\
  \ PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 22C3 pharmDx performed according to the manufacturer's\
  \ instructions for use."
- '* Patients must not have had prior systemic anticancer therapy administered in
  the incurable recurrent or metastatic setting. Systemic therapy which was completed
  more than 180 days prior to randomization, if given as part of multimodal treatment
  for locally advanced disease, is allowed.'
- '* Patients who have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by the
  site and confirmed by BICR. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area
  may be considered measurable, if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions
  disease by RECIST 1.1.'
- '* All patients must provide a tumor tissue sample (formalin fixed paraffin embedded
  \[FFPE\] blocks or both slides and curls) from archival tissue. Alternatively, a
  fresh biopsy sample could be provided if a biopsy sample is performed as part of
  the patient''s standard clinical practice before the first dose of trial treatment.
  The sample should be preferably derived from a current site of metastatic or recurrent
  disease. Otherwise, a sample from the primary tumor can be submitted.'
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - Medical conditions:'
- Exclude - * Patients present primary tumor site of nasopharynx (any histology).
- Exclude - * Patients with another primary malignancy that has not been in complete
  remission for at least 2 years, with the exception of those with a negligible risk
  of metastasis or death (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
  non-invasive basal or non-invasive squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate
  cancer, non-invasive superficial bladder cancer or breast ductal carcinoma in situ).
- 'Exclude - Prior/concomitant therapy:'
- 'Exclude - * Patients who have received or currently receive the following therapy/medication:'
- Exclude - 1. Chronic systemic immunosuppressive treatment including corticosteroid
  treatment (prednisone \>10 mg daily orally \[PO\] or intravenously \[IV\], or equivalent)
  in the 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.
- Exclude - 2. Prior treatment with other immune-modulating agents that was (a) within
  fewer than 4 weeks (28 days) or five half-lives of the agent (whichever is longer)
  prior to the first dose of BNT113, or (b) associated with immune-mediated AEs that
  have not resolved prior to the first dose of BNT113 or that pose an additional risk
  of on-trial complications, per investigator's assessment, or c) associated with
  toxicity that resulted in discontinuation of the immune-modulating agent and that
  poses an additional risk of on-trial complications, per investigator's assessment.
- Exclude - 3. Prior treatment with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks before
  the first dose of BNT113.
- Exclude - 4. Prior treatment with an investigational drug (including investigational
  vaccines) within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the agent (whichever is longer) before
  the planned first dose of BNT113.
- 'Exclude - 5. Ongoing treatment with therapeutic PO or IV antibiotics. Note: Patients
  receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract infection
  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may be enrolled.'
- Exclude - * Prior treatment with anti-cancer immunomodulating agents, such as blockers
  of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), PD-L1, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
  member 9 (TNRSF9, 4 1BB, CD137), OX 40, therapeutic vaccines, cytokine treatments,
  or any investigational agent within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the agent (whichever
  is longer) before the first dose of BNT113.
- 'Exclude - * Treatment with non-systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g., radiotherapy
  or surgery) within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Note: Prior treatment with bone
  resorptive therapy, such as bisphosphonates (e.g., pamidronate, zoledronic acid)
  and denosumab, is allowed.'
- 'Exclude - NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: "An open-label, controlled, multi-site, interventional, 2-arm, Phase II/III\
  \ trial of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab vs pembrolizumab monotherapy\
  \ as first line treatment in patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic\
  \ HPV16+ HNSCC expressing programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) with combined positive\
  \ score (CPS) \u22651.\n\nThis trial has two parts.\n\nPart A, is an initial non-randomized\
  \ Safety Run-In Phase to confirm the safety and tolerability at the selected dose\
  \ range level of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nPart B, is a randomized\
  \ part to generate pivotal efficacy and safety data of BNT113 in combination with\
  \ pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first line setting in patients\
  \ with unresectable recurrent or metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC expressing PD-L1 with CPS\
  \ \u22651. Patients included in the Safety Run-In Phase of the trial (Part A) will\
  \ not be randomized to Part B and will continue on-trial treatment (BNT113 plus\
  \ pembrolizumab) within Part A.\n\nFor Part B, an optional pre-screening phase is\
  \ available for all patients where patients' tumor samples may be submitted for\
  \ central HPV16 DNA and central PD-L1 expression testing prior to screening into\
  \ the main trial.\n\nPatients will be treated with BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab\
  \ or with pembrolizumab monotherapy for approximately up to 24 months."
