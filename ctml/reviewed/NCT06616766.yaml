prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* ECOG performance status 0 or 1'
- '* Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months'
- '* Patients who have progressed on or after all available standard therapies or
  for whom standard treatment is inappropriate'
- '* Mandatory provision of archived or fresh tumor tissue in quantity sufficient
  to allow for retrospective confirmation of HER2 or EGFR mutation'
- '* A patient with a history of brain metastases must have had all lesions treated'
- '* Adequate organ function defined as all of the following:'
- "* Adequate bone marrow function (within 1 week prior to first administration):\
  \ Neutrophils\u22651.5 x10\\*9 cells/L (Criteria must be met without the use of\
  \ Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) within last week prior to testing.);\
  \ platelet count\u226575 x10\\*9 cells/L; Hb \u22659g/dL (Criteria must be met without\
  \ packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion within last week prior to testing.)"
- "* Adequate hepatic function: Serum bilirubin\u22641.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN),\
  \ and serum transaminase (either aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase\
  \ (ALT)) \u2264 3 x ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases, or otherwise \u2264\
  \ 5 x ULN if transaminase elevation is attributable to liver metastases (within\
  \ 1 week prior to first administration)"
- "* Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN or Estimated glomerular\
  \ filtration rate (eGFR) \\> 60 mL/min per 1.73 m\\*2 according to the site's calculation\
  \ method."
- \[Dose Escalation part only\]
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, and/or metastatic
  non-hematologic malignancy'
- '* Documented HER2 or EGFR mutation (HER2 mutation or EGFR exon 20 insertion, HER2
  amplification or overexpression)'
- \[Dose Expansion part only\]
- '* Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
  NSCLC HER2 exon 20 insertion (Cohort 1)'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Patient with symptomatic or progressive brain metastases
- Exclude - * Known or suspected leptomeningeal disease (LMD)
- Exclude - * Uncontrolled spinal cord compression
- Exclude - * History of acute coronary syndromes, including myocardial infarction,
  coronary artery bypass graft, unstable angina, coronary angioplasty or stenting
  within past 24 weeks
- Exclude - * History of or current Class II, III or IV heart failure as defined by
  the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system
- Exclude - * Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that compromise
  the patients ability to understand the patient information, to give informed consent,
  to comply with the study protocol or to complete the study
- Exclude - * Any severe concurrent disease or condition (includes active infections,
  cardiac arrhythmia) that in the judgment of the Investigator would make study participation
  inappropriate for the patient
- Exclude - * History of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis
  that required steroids, or any evidence of current ILD or pneumonitis
- Exclude - * History of a second primary cancer with the exception of
- Exclude - 1. curatively treated non-melanomatous skin cancer,
- Exclude - 2. curatively treated cervical or breast carcinoma in situ, or
- Exclude - 3. other malignancy with no known active disease present and no treatment
  administered during the last 2 years
- Exclude - * Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or prior hepatitis
  B or active chronic hepatitis B or active hepatitis C
- Exclude - * Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment
