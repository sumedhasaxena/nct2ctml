summary: This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmaokinetics, and preliminary
  efficacy of mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio) monotherapy in participants with relapsed or
  refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study will also allow
  participants who are currently progressing on a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  (BTKi) and requiring salvage therapy as assessed by the treating physician to continue
  their BTKi throughout the screening period and for the first two cycles of mosunetuzumab.
  An additional arm (open to non-US participants only) has been added to assess the
  safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of mosunetuzumab
  in combination with venetoclax, a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor.
