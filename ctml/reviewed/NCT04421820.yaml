  \ have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy prior to enrollment in this study,\
  \ one of which was a 5-FU based regimen. Colorectal cancer (ARM VII): Patients must\

summary: BOLD-100 is an intravenously administered sterile solution containing the
  ruthenium-based small molecule. BOLD-100 has been shown to preferentially decrease
  the expression of GRP78 in tumour cells and ER stressed cells when compared to normal
  cells. BOLD-100 will be combined with cytotoxic FOLFOX chemotherapy in this study,
  with a dose escalation cohort to ensure tolerability and safety, followed by a cohort
  expansion phase.
