summary: 'The purpose of this clinical trial is to (1) learn whether the BCMA-CD3
  bispecific antibody elranatamab can provide more benefit to people with multiple
  myeloma compared to a combination therapy including daratumumab, pomalidomide, and
  dexamethasone, and (2) learn about the safety and activity of elranatamab in combination
  with the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab. People with multiple myeloma
  who have received previous treatment including lenalidomide will be enrolled in
  the study.


  Part 1 of the study will assess the safety and activity of different doses of elranatamab
  in combination with daratumumab.


  People participating in Part 2 of the study will be randomly assigned to receive
  either elranatamab alone, elranatamab plus daratumumab, or daratumumab, pomalidomide,
  and dexamethasone. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and activity of (1) elranatamab
  alone compared to daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone, and (2) elranatamab
  plus daratumumab.


  Part 3 will assess the effect of increased measures to protect against infection
  in people treated with either elranatamab alone or together with daratumumab.


  All people participating in the study will receive study treatment until their disease
  progresses, they experience unacceptable side effects, or they choose to no longer
  participate in the study.'
