- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'The main inclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:'
- '* Cohort A:'
- '* Has a diagnosis of hormone receptor positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
  2 negative (HR+/HER2-) invasive breast carcinoma that is either locally advanced
  disease not amenable to resection with curative intent (herein called unresectable)
  or metastatic disease not treatable with curative intent.'

  therapy in the metastatic setting.'
- '* Cohort B:'
- "* Has histologically confirmed high-grade epithelial (including high-grade serous\
  \ or predominantly serous, high-grade endometrioid, malignant mixed M\xFCllerian\
  \ tumors \\[carcinosarcoma\\], or clear cell) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary\
  \ peritoneal carcinoma."

  liver metastases, symptomatic pericardial effusion, symptomatic peritoneal carcinomatosis,
  or the need to achieve rapid symptom control.

  borderline tumors (low malignant potential), mucinous, seromucinous that is predominantly
  mucinous, malignant Brenner's tumor, low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, and
  undifferentiated carcinoma.

  per radiographic imaging within 180 days after the last dose of first-line \[1L\]
  platinum-based therapy) or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer (defined as disease
  that has progressed per radiographic imaging while receiving or within 28 days of
  the last dose of 1L platinum based therapy).
- Exclude - * Is a candidate for curative-intent surgery or curative-intent radiotherapy
  for ovarian cancer.
- 'Exclude - * Cohort C:'
- Exclude - * Has high-grade (FIGO Grade 3 or poorly differentiated) endometrioid
  carcinoma and nonendometrioid histologies of any type (including serous, clear cell,
  mixed, carcinosarcoma), and neuroendocrine tumors are not eligible. Uterine mesenchymal
  tumors such as an endometrial stromal sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, or other types of
  pure sarcomas, and adenosarcomas are not eligible.

- Exclude - * HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or
  Multicentric Castleman's Disease.
- Exclude - * Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before
  the first dose of study intervention. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.
- Exclude - * Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required
  active treatment within the past 3 years.

summary: 'Researchers want to learn if MK-5684 (the study medicine) can treat breast
  cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. MK-5684, the study medicine, is
  designed to treat cancer by blocking the body from making steroid hormones.


  Researchers will compare MK-5684 to the standard treatments for each cancer type
  in this study.


  The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive MK-5684 live longer without
  the cancer growing or spreading compared to people who receive a standard treatment.'
