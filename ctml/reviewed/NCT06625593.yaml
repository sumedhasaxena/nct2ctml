prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
- "2. Life expectancy of \u2265 3 months."
- '3. Prior standard systemic therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting. Dose
  Escalation: Participants for whom further standard treatment is not available, not
  tolerated or determined not appropriate based on the investigator''s judgment. Combo
  Dose Confirmation, Combo Safety Expansion, and Dose Expansion: Participants who
  have received at least 1 or 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, which included a
  fluoropyrimidine and/or a platinum in the advanced or metastatic setting'
- 4. Tumors with FGFR2b expression/ or FGFR2 gene amplification. Participants must
  provide agreement for collection of archival tissue or recently obtained fresh tumor
  biopsy for central evaluation of FGFR2b expression levels and other biomarker assessments.
- "5. \u2265 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1."
- 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.
- 7. Adequate organ function as determined per protocol.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Prior exposure to topoisomerase I inhibitor (TOP1i)-based antibody-drug
  conjugate (ADC) therapies or FGFR2b-targeted ADC therapies.
- Exclude - 2. Active or chronic corneal disorder, history of corneal transplantation,
  corneal keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation
  or ulceration, other active ocular conditions and any clinically significant corneal
  disease that prevents adequate monitoring of drug-induced keratopathy.
- Exclude - 3. Spinal cord compression, or active leptomeningeal disease or uncontrolled,
  untreated brain metastasis.
- "Exclude - 4. Systemic antitumor therapy (including targeted therapy and immunotherapy\
  \ \u2264 14 days, \u2264 28 days for immuno- oncological antibody, \u2264 14 days\
  \ or 5 half-lives \\[whichever is shorter\\] for chemotherapy, ADCs, or investigational\
  \ therapy) before first dose of study drug(s)."
- Exclude - 5. Toxicities due to prior therapy that have not recovered.
- "Exclude - 6. Any malignancy \u2264 2 years before first dose of study drug(s) except\
  \ for the specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally recurring\
  \ cancer that has been treated curatively."
- Exclude - 7. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD), noninfectious pneumonitis,
  oxygen saturation at rest \< 92%, or requirement for supplemental oxygen at baseline.
- 'Exclude - Note: Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.'

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
  (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-C137 alone and
  in combination with anticancer agents in participants with advanced solid tumors.
  The study will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1a (Monotherapy Dose Escalation,
  and Safety Expansion; Combination Dose Confirmation and Safety Expansion) and Phase
  1b (Dose Expansion).'
