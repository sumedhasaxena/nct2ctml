prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- Both Cohorts
- '* Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian
  cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.'
- '* Participants with platinum-resistant disease:'
- "* Participants with 1 prior line of platinum-based therapy who have received \u2265\
  \ 4 cycles of platinum and had a response (complete response (CR) or partial response\
  \ (PR)) followed by radiological progressive disease (PD) between \\> 3 months and\
  \ \u2264 6 months after the date of the last dose of platinum."
- '* Participants with 2 or 3 prior lines of platinum-based therapy who had radiological
  PD'
- '* 6 months after the date of the last dose of platinum.'
- '* Participants with progression diagnosed radiographically on or after their most
  recent line of therapy.'
- '* Participants with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG
  PS) of 0 or 1.'
- "* Participants with \u2265 1 lesion that meets the definition of measurable disease\
  \ by RECIST v1.1 (radiologically measured by the investigator)."
- "* Participants with a tumor that is positive for folate receptor alpha (FR\u03B1\
  ) expression as determined by the Ventana folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) assay (\u2265\
  \ 75% of tumor staining at 2+ intensity)."
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - Both Cohorts
- Exclude - * Participants with endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, or sarcomatous
  histology; mixed tumors containing any of the above histologies; or low-grade or
  borderline ovarian tumor.
- Exclude - * Participants with primary platinum-refractory disease, defined as disease
  that did not respond (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) or that progressed
  radiographically within 3 months of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing
  chemotherapy.
- Exclude - * Participants with serious concurrent illness or clinically relevant
  active infection as outlined in the protocol
- Exclude - * Participants with a history of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke within
  6 months prior to randomization.

summary: "Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce\
  \ uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy\
  \ of for Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in participants with platinum-resistant advanced\
  \ high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (platinum-resistant\
  \ ovarian cancer) (PROC) whose tumors express a high level of folate receptor alpha\
  \ (FR\u03B1).\n\nMirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational antibody\
  \ drug conjugate designed to selectively kill cancer cells. The antibody (protein)\
  \ part of MIRV targets tumors by delivering a cell-killing drug to cancer cells\
  \ carrying a protein called folate receptor alpha (FR\u03B1). There are 2 cohorts\
  \ in this study, the Randomized Phase 2 Cohort and the Hepatic Impairment Cohort.\
  \ In the Randomized Phase 2 Cohort, participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called\
  \ treatment arms. Each treatment arm receives MIRV on a different schedule (on day\
  \ 1 every 21 days or on days 1 and 15 every 28 days). The Hepatic Impairment Cohort\
  \ is designed to determine the starting dose of MIRV in patients with moderately\
  \ abnormal liver function. Around 110 participants will be enrolled in the study\
  \ at approximately 75 sites worldwide.\n\nThe total study duration will be approximately\
  \ 24 months.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial\
  \ compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during\
  \ the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments,\
  \ blood tests, and scans."
