- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "* Male or female participants at least 18 years of age (\u226518 years)"

  irrespective of mutational status, as defined per study phase and cohort, as follows:'
- 'o Phase 1a:'
- '* Participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.'
- '* For monotherapy dose escalation: participants must have progressed on or become
  intolerant to all available SOC therapies.'
- '* For combination dose escalation: participants must have received 3 or fewer prior
  lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting'

  (FFPE) tumor sample from the most recent biopsy of primary cancer or from a metastatic
  site for central testing. Tumor tissue (archival tumor tissue or a fresh biopsy)
  for all except ES-SCLC participants. Exemptions can be granted by the medical monitor
  for participants with bladder cancer and mCRPC. Tumor tissue is necessary for retrospective

  with pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab as most recent treatment regimen,
  with objective response (per RECIST 1.1) of SD or better and no PD, and otherwise
  qualifies for continued treatment with atezolizumab, durvalumab, or pembrolizumab
  per local practice guidelines (combination 2 only).'
- '* Additional inclusion criteria for Phase 1b Chinese participants:'
- 'Chinese participants are considered eligible if they meet all of the following:'
- '* Born in mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan'
- '* Descendant of 2 ethnic Chinese parents and 4 ethnic Chinese grandparents'

  at the same time: asymptomatic; medically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to initial
  dosing; no steroid treatment required for at least 2 weeks prior to initial dosing;
  and no midline shift due to herniation); or untreated progression due to brain metastasis

  glucocorticoids.
- Exclude - * Has donated blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL (approximately
  1 pint) within one month prior to first dose of study treatment.
- Exclude - * Has a history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatments
  in the 2 years prior to screening. Participants with prior history of autoimmune
  disease must be discussed with the medical monitor. Replacement therapy is not considered

summary: The goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical activity
  and pharmacokinetics of GSK5764227. The study will also see how the levels of GSK5764227
  will change over time at different dose amounts when administered alone and in combination
  with other medicines like carboplatin, cisplatin, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab,
  bevacizumab, cetuximab.
