prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Males or females aged \u2265 18 years."
- 2. Subjects with histological- or cytological-confirmed, advanced cancer who have
  progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard
  anticancer therapy exists
- 1. For Phase 1, all tumor types may be enrolled
- 2. For Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled as per the study design section above
- 3. ECOG performance status of 0-2.
- 4. Subjects who relapsed post-autologous or post-allogeneic transplant are eligible.
  Post-transplant subjects must be without active fungal disease or significant acute
  graft-versus-host disease
- 5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test (urine
  or serum) within 7 days prior to starting the study drug. Both males and females
  must agree to use effective birth control during the study (prior to the first dose
  and for 6 months after the last dose) if conception is possible during this interval.
- 6. Subjects must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and
  not have any clinically significant GI abnormalities that may alter the absorption,
  such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.
- 7. Able to agree to and sign the informed consent and to comply with the protocol.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Subjects with a history of brain metastases or who have signs/symptoms
  attributable to brain metastases and have not been assessed with radiologic imaging
  to rule out the presence of brain metastases. Subjects with treated brain metastases
  that are asymptomatic and have been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks will
  be eligible.
- Exclude - 2. Subjects who have not received vaccines for severe acute respiratory
  syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and have suspected signs and symptoms of the
  novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) or have confirmed COVID-19.
- 'Exclude - 3. Subjects with a history of another primary malignancy, other than:'
- Exclude - 1. In situ carcinomas, e.g., breast, cervix, and prostate
- Exclude - 2. Locally excised nonmelanoma skin cancer
- Exclude - 3. No evidence of disease from another primary cancer for 2 or more years
  and has not taken any anti-cancer treatment in 2 years.
- Exclude - 4. Any other clinically significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric
  condition or any laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with
  study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.
- Exclude - 5. Diseases that significantly affect GI absorption of CYC140.
- Exclude - 6. Subjects who have impaired cardiac function or clinically significant
  cardiac disease.
- Exclude - 7. Presence of active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis,
  Crohn's disease) or GI perforation within 6 months of enrollment
- Exclude - 8. Presence of an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics
- Exclude - 9. Presence of known history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 with
  uncontrolled viral load and on medications that may interfere with metabolism
- Exclude - 10. Presence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- Exclude - 11. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, extended-field
  radiotherapy, or investigational agents within 5 half-lives or 3 weeks (whichever
  is shorter) prior to administration of first dose of study drug on Day 1 or have
  not recovered from the side effects of such therapy.
- Exclude - 12. Major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4 weeks of the
  first dose

summary: This is a 2-part, phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate
  the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics,
  and efficacy of CYC140 administered orally daily. This study consists of Phase 1
  and Phase 2 components in subjects with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma who have
  progressed despite having standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.
