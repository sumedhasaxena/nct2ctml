summary: 'This is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
  (PK), and anti-tumor activity of RO7502175 when administered as a single agent and
  in combination with atezolizumab or pembrolizumab in adult participants with locally
  advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), melanoma, triple-negative breast
  cancer (TNBC), esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer
  (CRC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). Participants will be enrolled in 2 stages: dose escalation and
  dose expansion.'
