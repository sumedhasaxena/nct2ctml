summary: This will be a prospective, randomized, standard of care (SoC) controlled,
  parallel, open-label, multicenter pivotal study to investigate the efficacy and
  safety of Bevacizumab (BEV) in combination with or without microbubble (MB)-mediated
  FUS in patients with recurrent GBM. BEV represents the physician's best choice for
  the standard of care in rGBM after previous treatment with surgery (if appropriate),
  standard radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy, and with adjuvant temozolomide.
