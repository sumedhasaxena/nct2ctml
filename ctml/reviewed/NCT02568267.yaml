- '* Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic
  solid tumor that harbors an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene rearrangement'
- '* For patients enrolled via local molecular testing, an archival or fresh tumor
  tissue (unless medically contraindicated) is required to be submitted for independent
  central molecular testing at Ignyta''s CLIA laboratory post-enrollment'

summary: This is an open-label, multicenter, global Phase 2 basket study of entrectinib
  (RXDX-101) for the treatment of patients with solid tumors that harbor an NTRK1/2/3,
  ROS1, or ALK gene fusion. Patients will be assigned to different baskets according
  to tumor type and gene fusion.
