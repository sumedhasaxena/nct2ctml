prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Patients aged 18 years old or older
- 2. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score 0-1 within 28 days prior
  to recruitment
- 3. Patients who can sign the informed consent
- 4. Patients with stage III-IV histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial
  ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer not amenable for
  PDS
- 5. Patients who have baseline computed tomography (CT) of thorax, abdomen and pelvis.
- 6. Patients who are planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) using 3-weekly carboplatin
  and paclitaxel. Those who have received one cycle of NACT may be eligible if the
  CA125 schedule of the study group can be matched.
- 7. Patients who have an evaluable CA125 level at baseline (i.e., baseline level
  is at least 2x upper limit of normal)
- 8. Patients who agree for chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery (IDS) if the
  disease becomes operable after NACT
- 9. Patients with adequate hematologic, liver and renal functions for chemotherapy
- 10. Patients who agree to receive adjuvant chemotherapy after IDS. The total number
  of NACT and adjuvant chemotherapy should be four or above, up to maximum of 9 cycles.
- 11. Patients who have childbearing potential should practice highly effective contraception
  throughout the study until at least 30 days after completion of the treatment.
- 12. Patients must have either germline and / or somatic BRCA test, or homologous
  recombination deficiency (HRD) test.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Patients who have borderline malignancy, or non-EOC like germ cell
  or sex cord tumor, or metastatic diseases from other origins
- Exclude - 2. Patients with mucinous and neuroendocrine histology
- Exclude - 3. Patients with history of other malignancies within five years
- Exclude - 4. Patients who are eligible for primary debulking surgery (PDS)
- Exclude - 5. Patients who cannot undergo PDS because of parametrial and/or vaginal
  involvement alone
- Exclude - 6. Patients who are not fit for PDS because of medical morbidities or
  refusal of operation
- Exclude - 7. Patients who have already started NACT outside the study centers, except
  those who have received only one cycle within 7 days and the baseline CA125 value
  within 3 days of NACT (normal cut-off 35 U/ml) is available
- Exclude - 8. Patients who participate in other interventional studies
- Exclude - 9. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Exclude - 10. Patients who have contraindications to platinum-based chemotherapy
- Exclude - 11. Patents with active tuberculosis, history of positive test for human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
  are excluded.

summary: About 70% of epithelial ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced
  stage. When primary optimal surgery is not possible, neoadjuvant chemotherapy will
  followed by interval debulking surgery is one treatment option. However, there is
  no consensus on the optimal timing of the surgery. CA125 is a well-known tumor marker
  in ovarian cancer. Its kinetic change has been proven to correlate with the patients'
  response to chemotherapy and chance of optimal resection. This study aims to utilize
  the kinetic change of CA125 to customize the timing of surgery for individual patients
  and compare this with the standard clinical practice.
