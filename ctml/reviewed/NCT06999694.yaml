summary: Tremelimumab plus durvalumab (STRIDE regimen) is an approved first-line therapy
  for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet it shows limited efficacy with
  an ORR of only 20.1%. Proton radiotherapy (RT), known for its precision and tissue-sparing
  advantages, has demonstrated improved survival outcomes and reduced toxicity compared
  to X-ray RT. Retrospective data suggest that combining proton RT with immune checkpoint
  inhibitors yields a promising ORR of 61.5%. Preclinical studies further support
  enhanced antitumor immunity when RT is combined with PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade.
  This phase II, single-arm clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
  and immunologic effects of combining proton RT with tremelimumab and durvalumab
  in patients with unresectable HCC.
