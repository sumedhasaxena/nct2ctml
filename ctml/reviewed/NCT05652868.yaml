prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- 'Part 1:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
  NSCLC and have received available standard of care therapy.'
- '* There is no limit on the number of prior therapies that can have been received.'
- Part 2 Cohorts A-D and F
- 1. Known to not have an actionable EGFR mutation. Subjects with or without other
  driver mutations are permitted to enroll.
- 2. Must have received (or be ineligible for) available standard of care therapy.
- '3. Must have progressed on at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy in the locally
  advanced/metastatic setting. Note: multiple TKIs for the same actionable mutation
  count as 1 line of therapy. Rechallenge of the same therapy regimen within 6 months
  of discontinuation date of the therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy.
  Maintenance therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant
  therapies count as 1 line of therapy if given within 6 months before study entry.
  The same rules above apply to all inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding prior lines
  of therapy.'
- '4. Subjects without any actionable gene alteration: must have progressed on (or
  be considered ineligible for), or be intolerant to, platinum-based chemotherapy
  and immune checkpoint inhibitor (as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy)
  and have not received more than 2 lines of prior systemic therapy in the locally
  advanced/metastatic setting.'
- '5. Subjects with actionable gene alterations (other than EGFR) for which immune
  checkpoint inhibitor therapy is not standard of care (e.g., anaplastic lymphoma
  kinase \[ALK\] translocation): must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible
  for), or be intolerant to, anticancer therapy targeting driver gene alterations
  and platinum-based chemotherapy and have not received more than 3 lines of prior
  systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting.'
- '6. Subjects with actionable gene alterations (other than MET exon 14 skipping mutation)
  for which immune checkpoint inhibitor is standard of care: must have progressed
  on (or be considered ineligible for), or be intolerant to, anticancer therapy targeting
  driver gene alteration and platinum-based chemotherapy, and also progressed on (or
  be considered ineligible for) or be intolerant to immune checkpoint inhibitor(as
  monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, and have not received
  more than 3 lines of prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting.'

  to, at least one MET TKI if available, and have not received more than 2 lines of
  prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting.

  not a candidate for curative therapy), or metastatic NSCLC with actionable EGFR
  mutations.'

  does not meet inclusion criteria for Cohorts A,B, B2, or D.'
- All patients (Part 1 and Part 2)
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Patient has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1'
- '* ECOG performance status 0 or 1'

  agreement to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of
  the study treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.'
- '* Able to provide informed consent, and willing and able to comply with study protocol
  requirements'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - Radiation to the lung within 6 weeks prior to screening. For all other
  sites (except lung), therapeutic or palliative radiation within 2 weeks prior to
  the first dose of study drug. Must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicity.
- Exclude - Major surgery within 28 days of first dose of study drug administration.
- Exclude - Untreated, uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
  leptomeningeal disease.
- Exclude - * History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis that required treatment
  with systemic steroids or evidence of active interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.
  A history of prior radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.
- Exclude - * Clinically significant systemic illness that could pose undue risk to
  the subject or confound the ability to interpret study results.
- Exclude - * Active infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungal
  medication within 14 Days of Cycle 1 Day 1

summary: This is a Phase I open label multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of the investigational drug MYTX-011
  in patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. MYTX-011 is in
  a class of medications called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). MYTX-011 is composed
  of a pH-dependent anti-cMET antibody and the potent antimicrotubule drug monomethyl
  auristatin E (MMAE).
