summary: 'The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of PF-07220060
  with letrozole compared to approved treatments (ie, palbociclib, ribociclib or abemaciclib
  with letrozole) in people with breast cancer:


  * HR-positive (breast cancer cells that need estrogen or progesterone to grow)

  * HER2-negative (cells that have a small amount or none of a protein called HER2
  on their surface);

  * locally advanced (that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph
  nodes) or metastatic disease (the spread of cancer to other places in the body)

  * who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment for advanced/metastatic
  disease.


  Approximately half of the participants will receive PF-07220060 plus letrozole while
  the other half of participants will receive the investigator''s choice of treatment
  plus letrozole.


  The study team will monitor how each participant is doing with the study treatment
  during regular visits at the study clinic.'
