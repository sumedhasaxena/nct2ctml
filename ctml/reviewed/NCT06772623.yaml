summary: 'Non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most frequently occurring histologic
  subtype of lung cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
  The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change in disease activity
  when Telisotuzumab Adizutecan (ABBV-400) is given in combination with a programmed
  cell death receptor 1 (PD1) immune checkpoint inhibitor to adult participants to
  treat NSCLC.


  Telisotuzumab Adizutecan (ABBV-400) and budigalimab are investigational drugs being
  developed for the treatment of NSCLC. This study will be divided into two stages,
  with the first stage treating participants with several doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan
  in combination with budigalimab within the dose escalation regimen until the dose
  reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. In Stage 2 there will be 3
  treatment groups. Two groups will receive pembrolizumab with different optimized
  doses of telisotuzumab adizutecan (to allow for the best dose to be studied in the
  future). One group will receive the standard of care (SOC) - pembrolizumab, pemetrexed,
  and investigator''s choice of carboplatin or cisplatin, followed by pembrolizumab
  and pemetrexed. Approximately 132 adult participants with NSCLC will be enrolled
  in the study in 132 sites worldwide.


  In the dose escalation stage participants will be treated with increasing intravenous
  (IV) doses of Telisotuzumab Adizutecan in combination with budigalimab until the
  dose of Telisotuzumab Adizutecan reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious.
  In the dose optimization stage participants will be receive IV optimized doses of
  Telisotuzumab Adizutecan in combination with IV pembrolizumab, or IV SOC - pembrolizumab,
  pemetrexed, and investigator''s choice of carboplatin or cisplatin, followed by
  pembrolizumab and pemetrexed. The study will run for a duration of approximately
  33 months.


  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to
  their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study
  at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will
  be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side
  effects.'
