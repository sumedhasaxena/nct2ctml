summary: This is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-human dose escalation and dose
  expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
  and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-58067 alone, in combination with BG-89894,
  and in combination with standard of care therapy in participants with advanced solid
  tumors and with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) deficiency.
