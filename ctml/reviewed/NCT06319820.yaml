prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis (within 90 days of randomization) of
  IR-NMIBC with at least one of the following criteria fulfilled: a. Ta low grade
  (LG)/ Grade 1 (G1): primary or recurrent, b. Ta LG/G2: primary or recurrent and
  c. Greater than or equal to (\>=) 1 of the following risk factors: i. Multiple Ta
  LG tumors, ii. Solitary LG tumor \>= 3 cm, iii. Early recurrence (less than \[\<\]
  1 year), iv. Frequent recurrence (greater than \[\>\] 1 per year), v. Recurrence
  after prior adjuvant intravesical treatment (single perioperative dose of chemotherapy
  does not fulfill this risk factor)'
- '* Have a susceptible fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation or fusion
  either by urine testing or tumor tissue testing (from TURBT tissue), as determined
  by central or local testing'
- '* Participants must be willing to undergo all study procedures (e.g., multiple
  cystoscopies from Screening through the end of study and TURBT for assessment of
  recurrence/progression) and receive the assigned treatment, including intravesical
  chemotherapy if randomized into that arm.'
- '* Visible papillary disease must be fully resected prior to randomization and absence
  of disease must be documented at Screening cystoscopy'
- '* Can have a prior or concurrent second malignancy (other than the disease under
  study) which natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any study
  endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the study treatment'
- '* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - * Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any study component
  or its excipients, including: a. Erdafitinib excipients; b.TAR-210 drug delivery
  system constituent materials ; c. urinary placement catheter materials; d. MMC or
  chemically related drugs; e. Gemcitabine or chemically related drugs'
- Exclude - * Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature (that is, urethral
  stricture) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may prevent the safe insertion,
  indwelling use, removal of TAR-210 or passage of a urethral catheter for intravesical
  chemotherapy
- Exclude - * Polyuria with recorded 24-hour urine volumes \> 4000 milliliters (mL)
- Exclude - * Current indwelling urinary catheters, however, intermittent catheterization
  is acceptable
- Exclude - * Had major surgery or had significant traumatic injury and/or not fully
  recovered within 4 weeks before first dose (TURBT is not considered major surgery)

      arm_description: Participants in Group A will have TAR-210 inserted in the bladder
        on Day 1 and removed after 12 weeks. One TAR-210 will be inserted every 12
