summary: 'Elranatamab is a bispecific antibody: binding of elranatamab to CD3-expressing
  T-cells and BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cells causes targeted T-cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate if the combination of
  Elranatamab, Daratumumab and Lenalidomide or Elranatamab and Lenalidomide offers
  superior clinical benefit compared with the combination of Daratumumab, Lenalidomide
  and Dexamethasone in people with multiple myeloma.


  There are 2 parts to this study. Part 1 will characterize the safety and tolerability
  of elranatamab in combination with daratumumab and lenalidomide or in combination
  with lenalidomide and will identify the optimal dose(s) of the combination regimen.
  Part 2 of the study will evaluate the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity
  rate and the progression free survival (PFS) of the combination of elranatamab,
  daratumumab, and lenalidomide or elranatamab and lenalidomide compared with the
  combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in participants with
  newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma.'
