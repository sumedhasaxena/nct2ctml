summary: 'First-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy is the standard first-line
  treatment for unresectable or metastatic advanced biliary tract cancer and the optimal
  duration of the treatment is not mentioned in current clinical guidelines. In the
  pivotal phase 3 ABC-02 trial, patients received up to 6 to 8 cycles of treatment
  and stopped without maintenance and our retrospective study shows no significant
  benefit of continuing gemcitabine plus cisplatin beyond 6 to 8 cycles. However,
  the survival outcomes of patients who completed 6 to 8 cycles of gemcitabine plus
  cisplatin without progression are dismal with progression-free survival from the
  last dose of the treatment of median 5.2 months in a prior retrospective study.
  Indeed, there is an unmet clinical need in terms of maintenance therapy for advanced
  biliary tract cancer without progression to first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin
  chemotherapy.


  Durvalumab with/without tremelimumab, anti-CTLA4 inhibitor, showed encouraging results
  in recently presented study for treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer combination
  with gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Combination of olaparib and durvalumab showed promising
  results for metastatic HER-2 negative BRCA mutated breast cancer. For DDR gene mutated
  advanced biliary tract cancer, olaparib plus durvalumab combination may show synergistic
  effect with better efficacy than olaparib monotherapy. Both olaparib and durvalumab
  are relatively well tolerated compared to other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.
  Olaparib may have some degree of myelosuppression, most patients are expected to
  well tolerate. Although combination of durvalumab and olaparib may cause additional
  adverse events, these also might be tolerable, considering that there are no overlapping
  toxicities between durvalumab and olaparib and the safety data for the combination
  of durvalumab with olaparib. Considering poor prognosis in patients with advanced
  biliary tract cancer and lack of maintenance treatment following scheduled first-line
  GemCis, clinical benefits with maintenance olaparib or olaparib plus durvalumab
  weigh more than the potential risks.'
