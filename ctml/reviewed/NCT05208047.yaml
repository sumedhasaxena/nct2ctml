prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- 1. Histologically confirmed locally advanced, metastatic, and/or unresectable GIST.
  Molecular pathology report must be available for Part 2; if molecular pathology
  report is unavailable or inadequate, an archival or fresh tumor tissue sample will
  be required to evaluate mutational status prior to randomization.
- 2. Documented disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib
- '3. Subjects must have received the following treatment:'
- "DDI Substudy/Part 1a: Treatment with \u22651 prior lines of therapy for GIST Part\
  \ 1b: Treatment with \u22652 prior TKI for GISTs Part 2: Prior treatment with imatinib\
  \ only"
- 4. Have at least 1 measurable lesion according to mRECIST v1.1 (Part1a, Part 1b,
  Part 2)
- 5. ECOG - 0 to 2
- 6. Have clinically acceptable local laboratory screening results (clinical chemistry
  and hematology) within certain limits
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. Known PDGFR driving mutations or known succinate dehydrogenase deficiency
- Exclude - 2. Clinically significant cardiac disease
- Exclude - 3. Major surgeries (eg, abdominal laparotomy) within 4 weeks of the first
  dose of study drug
- Exclude - 4. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including, but not limited to, significant
  nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant bowel
  resection that would preclude adequate absorption
- Exclude - 5. Any active bleeding excluding hemorrhoidal or gum bleeding
- Exclude - 6. Seropositive for HIV 1 or 2, or positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
  or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.
- Exclude - 7. Active, uncontrolled, systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infections
  at Screening
- Exclude - 8. Received strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers
- Exclude - 9. Received sunitinib within 3 weeks (Part 1a, Part 1b, DDI Substudy)

summary: 'This is a Phase 3, open-label, international, multicenter study of CGT9486
  in combination with sunitinib. This is a multi-part study that will enroll approximately
  442 patients. Part 1 consists of two evaluations: 1) confirming the dose of an updated
  formulation of CGT9486 to be used in subsequent parts in approximately 20 patients
  who have received at least one prior line of therapy for GIST and 2) evaluating
  the potential for drug-drug interactions between CGT9486 and sunitinib in approximately
  18 patients who have received at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
  for GISTs. The second part of the study will enroll approximately 388 patients who
  are intolerant to, or who failed prior treatment with imatinib only and will compare
  the efficacy of CGT9486 plus sunitinib to sunitinib alone with patients being randomized
  in a 1:1 manner. Additionally, a drug-drug interactions substudy will investigate
  the potential for CGT9486 to be a CYP3A4 inducer in approximately 16 patients who
  have received at least one prior line of therapy for GIST.'
