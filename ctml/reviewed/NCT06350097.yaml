prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- Age
- "1. Participant must be \u2265 18 years."
- Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics
- 2. Histologically or cytologically documented nonsquamous NSCLC. NSCLC of mixed
  histology is allowed if adenocarcinoma is the predominant histology. Mixed small-cell
  lung cancer and NSCLC histology, and sarcomatoid variant of NSCLC is ineligible.
- 3. Stage IIIB or IIIC or Stage IV metastatic NSCLC or recurrent NSCLC (based on
  the American Joint Committee on Cancer Edition 8) not amenable to curative surgery
  or definitive chemoradiation at the time of randomisation.
- 4. Participants must not have received prior EGFR TKIs or other systemic therapy
  for Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV NSCLC.
- 5. The tumour harbors at least 1 of the 2 common EGFR mutations known to be associated
  with EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del or L858R), either alone or in combination with
  other genomic alterations, which may include EGFR T790M, assessed by a CLIA-certified
  (US sites) or an accredited (outside of the US) local laboratory or by central prospective
  tissue testing.
- 6. For participants enrolled in randomisation period, mandatory provision of an
  unstained, archival tumour tissue sample in a quantity sufficient to allow for central
  confirmation of the EGFR mutation status.
- 7. WHO performance status of 0 or 1.
- "8. At least one lesion not previously irradiated that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1\
  \ TL at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as \u226510 mm in the\
  \ longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis \u226515 mm)\
  \ with CT or MRI and is suitable for accurate repeated measurements."
- 9. Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function within 7 days before the first
  dose of study intervention.
- Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements
- 10. Contraceptive use by males or females should be consistent with local regulations
  regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
- Other Inclusion Criteria
- 11. All races, gender and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - 1. As judged by the investigator, any evidence of diseases (such as severe
  or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diseases, psychiatric
  illness/social situations), history of allogenic organ transplant, and/or substance
  abuse which, in the investigator's opinion, makes it undesirable for the participant
  to participate in the study or that would jeopardise compliance with the protocol.
- Exclude - 2. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal disease, inability
  to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant bowel resection that
  would preclude adequate absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of osimertinib.
- Exclude - 3. History of another primary malignancy.
- Exclude - 4. Spinal cord compression and unstable brain metastases, as defined by
  Protocol.
- Exclude - 5. Clinically significant corneal disease.
- Exclude - 6. Has active or uncontrolled hepatitis B or C virus infection, as defined
  by Protocol.
- Exclude - 7. Known HIV infection that is not well controlled, as defined by Protocol.
- Exclude - 8. Uncontrolled infection requiring i.v. antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals;
  suspected infections (eg, prodromal symptoms); or inability to rule out infections
  (participants with localised fungal infections of skin or nails are eligible).
- Exclude - 9. Resting ECG with clinically abnormal findings, as defined by Protocol.
- Exclude - 10. Uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, as defined by Protocol.
- Exclude - 11. Past medical history of ILD/penumonitis, including radiation pneumonitis
  (apart from radiation pneumonitis that did not require steroids), or drug-induced
  ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging
  at screening.
- Exclude - 12. Pulmonary embolism within 3 months of the study enrolment or has severe
  pulmonary function compromise.
- Exclude - Prior/Concomitant Therapy
- Exclude - 13. Prior exposure to any agent including an ADC containing a chemotherapeutic
  agent targeting topoisomerase I, TROP2-targeted therapy.
- Exclude - Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience
- Exclude - 14. Participants with a known history of severe hypersensitivity reactions
  to either Dato-DXd and osimertinib or any excipients of Dato DXd and osimertinib
  or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to DXd and osimertinib.

summary: 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of osimertinib
  (tablet) in combination with Dato-DXd (i.v. infusion) compared with osimertinib
  (tablet) monotherapyas a first-line therapy in participants with locally advanced
  or metastatic EGFRm (Ex19del and/or L858R) NSCLC.


  Study details include:


  1. The study duration will be event-driven, with an estimated duration of approximately
  9 years.

  2. Participants may receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
  toxicity, or other specific discontinuation criteria are met.

  3. The visit frequency will be every 3 weeks during the treatment period.


  Note: Participants on osimertinib treatment(osimertinib only arm or who have discontinued
  Dato-DXd while are still receiving osimertinib) are required to attend visits to
  perform assessments every 6 weeks from Cycle 7 until Cycle 17 and then visits every
  12 weeks until disease progression or IP discontinuation. Participants who are receiving
  osimertinib + Dato-DXd are still required to attend visit to perform assessment
  every 3 weeks (q3w) per SoA.'
