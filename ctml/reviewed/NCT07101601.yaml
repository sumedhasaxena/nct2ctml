summary: 'DM5167 is a second-generation of PARP inhibitor that selectively targets
  the PARP-1 enzyme. This results in less haematological toxicity and a high level
  of safety.


  The aim of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DM5167 in patients
  with advanced solid tumors not respond to other treatments.'
