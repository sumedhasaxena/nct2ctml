  Period and for 4 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not
  to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period.
  The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in
  relationship to the first dose of study intervention.'
