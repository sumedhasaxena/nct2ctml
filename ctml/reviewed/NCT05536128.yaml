  can be discussed with the principal investigator at the molecular tumour board.
- 1.2 Exclusion criteria Medical conditions
- 1. As judged by the investigator, any evidence of condition or illness which in
  the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in
  the trial.

  5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated\
  \ in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage 1, grade\
  \ 1 endometrial carcinoma."

  as judged by the investigator (eg., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic
  arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QTcF prolongation \>500 ms, electrolyte disturbances,
  etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
- 4. Persistent toxicities (\>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE)
  v5.0 grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia grade 2.
