summary: The objective of this bridging study is to acquire new drug approval in Korea
  for camrelizumab (SHR-1210), a drug that has already been approved in China for
  treatment in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or
  metastatic (Stage IIIB-IV), EGFR/ALK wild-type, non-squamous, non-small cell lung
  cancer. In this study, subjects with advanced or metastatic, EGFR/ALK wild-type,
  non-squamous, non-small lung cancer will receive anti-PD-1 antibody therapy of camrelizumab
  in combination with pemetrexed + carboplatin as first-line treatment for at least
  8 cycles (24 weeks). Then, the best overall RECIST responses (BOR) from subjects
  who have had at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment will be evaluated to confirm
  that camrelizumab, a drug that has already been approved China, has similar efficacy
  in the Korean population as in the Chinese population.
