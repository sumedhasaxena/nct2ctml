prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Histologically or cytologically documented squamous NSCLC.'
- '* Stage IV mNSCLC (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer Edition 8) not
  amenable to curative treatment.'
- '* Absence of documented tumor genomic mutation results from tests conducted as
  part of standard local practice in any actionable driver oncogenes for which there
  are locally approved targeted 1L therapies.'
- "* Provision of acceptable tumor sample to confirm tumor PD-L1 expression TC \u2265\
  \ 1%."
- "* At least one lesion not previously irradiated that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1\
  \ TL at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the\
  \ longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm)\
  \ with CT or MRI and is suitable for accurate repeated measurements."
- '* Adequate organ and bone marrow function.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Presence of small cell and neuroendocrine histology components.
- Exclude - * Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not requiring steroids
  or anticonvulsants for at least 7 days prior to randomization. A minimum of 2 weeks
  must have elapsed between the end of local therapy (brain radiotherapy or surgery)
  and randomization. Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effect
  of radiotherapy (eg, dizziness and signs of increased intracranial pressure) or
  surgery prior to randomization.
- Exclude - * Any prior systemic therapy received for advanced or mNSCLC.
- Exclude - * Any prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent.
- Exclude - * Any prior exposure to an anti-TIGIT therapy or any other anticancer
  therapy targeting immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms.
- "Exclude - * History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated\
  \ with curative intent with no known active disease \u2265 2 years before the first\
  \ dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence."
- Exclude - * Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring
  chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.
- Exclude - * Active primary immunodeficiency/active infectious disease(s).
- Exclude - * Active tuberculosis infection.

summary: The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung02 is to assess the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig
  in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line (1L) treatment
  of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) whose tumors
  express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
