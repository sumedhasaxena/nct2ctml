- 'Inclusion Criteria:'
- '* Disease Characteristics - Breast, Prostate, and Lung Cancer'
- '* Part 1A (Monotherapy Dose Escalation) Histological or cytological diagnosis of
  locally advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer, CRPC, or NSCLC that is intolerant
  or resistant to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.'
- '* Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 1D and Part 1E (Combination Dose Escalation) Histological
  or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer.
  Participants must have progressed after at least 1 prior line of treatment with
  an endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor in the advanced or metastatic setting.'
- '* Part 2A (ER+HER2- breast cancer 2L+, monotherapy) Histological or cytological
  diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer. Participants
  must have progressed after at least 1 prior line of CDK4/6 inhibitor and 1 line
  of endocrine therapy.'
- '* Part 2B (ER+HER2- breast cancer 2-4L, combination with fulvestrant) Histological
  or cytological diagnosis of advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer. Participants
  must have progressive disease after at least 1 prior line of a CDK4/6 inhibitor
  and at least 1 prior line of endocrine therapy.. Participants must not have received
  more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapies including up to 1 line of cytotoxic
  chemotherapy for visceral disease in advanced or metastatic setting; Participants
  may have but are not required to have prior treatment with fulvestrant.'
- '* Part 2D (ER+HER2- breast cancer 2-4L, combination with PF-07220060 (CDK4i) and
  fulvestrant):'
- Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast
  cancer. Participants must have progressive disease after at least 1 prior line of
  a CDK4/6 inhibitor and at least 1 prior line of endocrine therapy.
- '* Participants must have not received more than 3 lines of systemic therapies including
  up to 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for visceral disease in advanced or metastatic
  setting; Participants may have but are not required to have prior treatment with
  fulvestrant.'
- '* Part 2E (ER+HER2- breast cancer 2-4L, combination with vepdegestrant): Histological
  or cytological diagnosis of advanced or metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer. Participants
  must have progressive disease after at least 1 prior line of a CDK4/6 inhibitor
  and at least 1 prior line of endocrine therapy; Participants must have not received
  more than 3 lines of systemic therapies including up to 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy
  for visceral disease in advanced or metastatic setting; Participants may have received
  fulvestrant'
- "* Participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have documentation\
  \ of ER-positive tumor (\u22651% positive stained cells) based on most recent tumor\
  \ biopsy utilizing an assay consistent with local standards."
- '* Participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have documentation
  of HER2-negative tumor: HER2-negative tumor is determined as immunohistochemistry
  score 0/1+ or negative by in situ hybridization (FISH/CISH/SISH/DISH) defined as
  a HER2/CEP17 ratio \<2 or for single probe assessment a HER2 copy number \<4.'
- '* Female participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer considered
  to be of childbearing potential (or have tubal ligations only) must be willing to
  undergo medically induced menopause by treatment with the approved LHRH agonist
  such as goserelin, leuprolide or equivalent agents to induce chemical menopause.'
- '* Female participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer of nonchildbearing
  potential must meet at least 1 criteria of achieving postmenopausal status.'
- '* Participants must have at least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version
  1.1 that has not been previously irradiated.'
- '* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status PS 0 or 1'
- "* Female or male patients aged \u2265 18 years (Japan \u2265 20 years) (South Korea\
  \ \u2265 19 years)."
- '* Adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function.'
- '* Resolved acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline severity or CTCAE Grade
  1 except for adverse events (AEs) not constituting a safety risk by investigator
  judgment.'
- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- Exclude - * Unmanageable ascites (limited medical treatment to control ascites is
  permitted, but all participants with ascites require review by sponsor's medical
  monitor).
- Exclude - * Participants with any other active malignancy within 3 years prior to
  enrollment, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer,
  or carcinoma in situ.
- Exclude - * Major surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic anti-cancer therapy within
  3 weeks prior to study entry.
- Exclude - * Prior irradiation to \>25% of the bone marrow.
- Exclude - * ECG clinically relevant abnormalities (eg, QTc \>470 msec, complete
  LBBB, second/third degree AV block, ST elevation or EKG changes suggesting myocardial
  infarction or active myocardia ischemia).
- Exclude - * Therapeutic anticoagulation. However, low molecular weight heparin is
  allowed. Vitamin K antagonists or factor Xa inhibitors may be allowed following
  discussion with the Sponsor.
- Exclude - * Known or suspected hypersensitivity or severe allergy to active ingredient/excipients
  of PF-07248144.
- Exclude - * Active inflammatory GI disease, refractory and unresolved chronic diarrhea
  or previous gastric resection, lap band surgery or other GI conditions and surgeries
  that may significantly alter the absorption of PF-07248144 tablets. Gastroesophageal
  reflux disease under treatment is allowed.
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breastfeeding female participants.
