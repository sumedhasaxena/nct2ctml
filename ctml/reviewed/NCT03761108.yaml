prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion Criteria:'
- "1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 1"
- 2. Confirmed diagnosis of active Multiple Myeloma (MM) by International Myeloma
  Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria
- 3. Patients must have myeloma that is response-evaluable according to the 2016 IMWG
  response criteria as defined in the protocol.
- '* Phase 1, Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Patients with MM who have exhausted all therapeutic
  options that are expected to provide meaningful clinical benefit, either through
  disease relapse, treatment refractory disease or intolerance of the therapy and
  including either:'
- a. Progression on or after at least 3 lines of therapy, or intolerance of therapy,
  including a proteasome inhibitor, an Immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and an anti-CD38
  antibody, OR b. Progression on or after an anti-CD38 antibody and have disease that
  is "double refractory" to a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD, or intolerance of
  therapy. The anti-CD38 antibody may have been administered alone or in combination
  with another agent such as a proteasome inhibitor (PI). Refractory disease is defined
  as lack of response or relapse within 60 days of last treatment.
- '* Phase 1, Part 2 (SC Administration): Patients with MM whose disease meets the
  following criteria:'
- a. Progression on or after at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a(n) PI,
  IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody, OR b. Patients must be triple-refractory, defined
  as being refractory to prior treatment with at least 1 anti-CD38 antibody, a proteasome
  inhibitor, and an IMiD.
- '* Phase 2 (Cohorts 1 and 2):'
- 'Patients with MM whose disease meets the following criteria:'
- a. Progression on or after at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a(n) PI,
  IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody, OR b. Patients must be triple- refractory, defined
  as being refractory\* to prior treatment with at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and an anti-CD38
  antibody.
- '* Phase 2 (Cohort 3):'
- 'Patients with MM whose disease meets the following criteria:'
- 1. Progression on or after at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a(n) PI,
  IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody, OR
- 2. Patients must be triple- refractory, defined as being refractory\* to prior treatment
  with at least 1 PI, 1 IMiD, and an anti-CD38 antibody.
- '* Refractory disease is defined as progression during treatment or within 60 days
  after completion of therapy, or \<25% response to therapy.'
- 'AND, for ALL patients, if they have relapsed after a BCMA-directed CAR-T cellular
  therapy then:'
- "\u2022 Treatment with a CAR-T must have been associated with a response of PR or\
  \ better, and"
- "\u2022 If CAR-T cellular therapy was the most recent prior therapy, excluding corticosteroids,\
  \ then treatment must have been a minimum of 60 days prior to treatment with linvoseltamab."
- 'Exclude - Key Exclusion Criteria:'
- "Exclude - 1\\. Diagnosis of plasma cell leukemia, primary systemic light-chain\
  \ amyloidosis, (excluding myeloma-associated amyloidosis), Waldenstr\xF6m macroglobulinemia\
  \ (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma), or POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly,\
  \ endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) 2. Patients with known MM\
  \ brain lesions or meningeal involvement 3. Cardiac ejection fraction \\<40% by\
  \ echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) 4. Prior treatment with\
  \ BCMA-directed immunotherapies, including BCMA bispecific antibodies and BiTEs.\
  \ Note: BCMA antibody-drug conjugates are not excluded and BCMA-directed CAR-T treatment\
  \ is not excluded in Phase 2 Cohort 3."
- Exclude - 5\. History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation at any time, or autologous
  stem cell transplantation within 12 weeks of the start of study treatment

summary: 'The main purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of linvoseltamab
  and to find out what is the best dose of linvoseltamab to give to patients with
  multiple myeloma and to look for any signs that linvoseltamab can effectively treat
  cancer.


  The study is looking at several other research questions, including:


  * Side effects that may be experienced by people receiving linvoseltamab

  * How linvoseltamab works in the body

  * How much linvoseltamab is present in the blood

  * How linvoseltamab may work to treat cancer'
