prior_treatment_requirements:
- 'Key Inclusion criteria:'
- '* Patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic MSIhi or MMR deficient (dMMR)
  solid tumors who have progressed after or are intolerant to prior standard therapy.'
- '* Arm A and C: Patients must have progressed on the most recent therapy for advanced
  disease including one prior line of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.'
- '* Arm B: Patients should have received prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy,
  and patients should have received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor or should be
  expected to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.'
- "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status \u2264 1"
- '* Measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1'
- '* HRO761 s.a. (Arm A) dose finding only: Patients must have a site of disease amenable
  to biopsy and be a candidate for tumor biopsy according to the treating institution''s
  guidelines. Patients must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening,
  and during therapy on the study. A biopsy from the same lesion is preferred if safe
  and medically feasible. Exceptions may be considered after documented discussion
  with Novartis.'
- '* All patients (Arm A, B and C) will have available archival tumor tissue obtained
  prior to study treatment initiation (in addition to newly obtained tumor biopsy
  at screening for Arm A), to allow retrospective MSIhi/dMMR status confirmation.'
- 'Key Exclusion criteria:'
- '* Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease'
- '* Clinically significant eye impairment'
- '* Patients with a primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumor or tumor metastatic
  to the CNS'
- '* Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection'
- '* Active Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or Tuberculosis infection.
  Patients whose disease is controlled under antiviral therapy should not be excluded.'
- '* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any ingredient of study drug(s)'
- '* Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
  significantly alter the absorption of study drugs (e.g., severe ulcerative disease,
  uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection),
  except for prior gastrectomy.'
- Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply

summary: The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability
  of HRO761 and identify the recommended dose(s), i.e., the optimal safe and active
  dose of HRO761 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab or irinotecan that can
  be given to patients who have cancers with specific molecular alterations called
  MSIhi (Microsatellite Instability-high) or dMMR (Mismatch Repair Deficient) that
  might work best to treat these specific cancer types and to understand how well
  HRO761 is able to treat those cancers.
