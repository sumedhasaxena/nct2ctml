summary: 'Atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1; anti-PD-L1) in conjunction
  with bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; anti-VEGF) has become
  the established standard first-line systemic treatment for unresectable hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). Despite an improved objective response rate (ORR) of 27%, the majority
  of patients face HCC progression and liver failure \[Finn et al., N Engl J Med 2020\].
  Developing a new combined treatment strategy to overcome resistance to anti-PD-L1
  and anti-VEGF is essential to improve patient outcomes.


  Radiation treatment (RT) is notably effective in managing localized solid tumors
  and is a fundamental component of unresectable HCC treatment. Recent retrospective
  cohorts have demonstrated that proton RT targeting all hepatic tumors, along with
  PD-L1/programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade, enhances ORR and progression-free survival
  for unresectable HCC patients, displaying a favorable safety profile (Su et al.,
  Am J Cancer Res. 2022). Our preclinical study (Hsieh et al., Sci Immunol 2022) showcased
  that RT combined with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade stimulates immunogenic cell death and
  antigen cross-presentation in murine tumor models, promoting systemic antitumor
  T cell responses. Nonetheless, it is crucial to verify whether the combined therapy
  of proton RT, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab triggers synergistic antitumor effects
  and systemic immune activation in clinical trials for unresectable HCC. This phase
  II non-randomized trial aims to prospectively evaluate therapeutic efficacy, safety,
  and immunological responses in patients with unresectable HCC treated with atezolizumab/bevacizumab
  combined with proton radiotherapy.'
