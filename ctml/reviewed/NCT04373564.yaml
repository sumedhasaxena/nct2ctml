summary: 'This study is a postmarketing requirement jointly carried out by four NDA
  holders (Bayer AG, Bracco, GE Healthcare and Guerbet) and the CRO IQVIA.


  The study aims to create detailed images of the organs and tissue of the human body
  during x-ray, CT-scan or MRI investigations, doctors are using contrast media (a
  kind of dye) which can be given to patients by injection into a blood vessel or
  by mouth.


  In this study researchers want to find out whether so called gadolinium-based contrast
  agents (GBCAs) have an effect on body movement and mental skills when given to participants
  multiple times within 5 years.


  The study plans to enroll about 2076 participants suffering from a condition for
  which they are likely to have at least annually a MRI or another imaging examinations.
  Only adults up to 65 years will be considered to join this study. During the study
  duration of 5 years participants will receive annually a MRI or other imaging tests
  (such as CT-scan, x-ray) and will visit the study doctor at least 7 times for physical
  examinations, laboratory investigations and tests on body movement and mental skills.'
