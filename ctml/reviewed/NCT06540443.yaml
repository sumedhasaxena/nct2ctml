summary: This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of MPB-2043, a superparamagnetic
  iron oxide (SPIO) contrast agent, for enhancing MRI in detecting metastatic lymph
  nodes in head and neck cancer. The study compares four doses of MPB-2043 (0.5 mg/kg,
  1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg) and assesses the optimal timing for post-dose imaging
  using T1/T2/T2\*-weighted sequences to improve the accuracy of nodal staging.
