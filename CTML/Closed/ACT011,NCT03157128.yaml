 Primary Objectives: (1) (Phase 1 part) To determine MTD/recommended phase 2 dose of LOXO-292. (2) (Phase 2 part) To assess, for each phase 2 expansion cohort, the anti-tumor activity of LOXO-292. Secondary Endpoints: (1) To determine safety profile and tolerability, characterize PK properties, toxicities and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LOXO-292. Exploratory Objectives: (1) To determine relationship between PK and drug effects. (2) To evaluate the serum tumor markers before, during, and at the end of treatment with LOXO-292 (for thyroid cancers patients only). (3) To characterize RET gene fusions and mutations by molecular analysis. (4) To collect patient reported outcomes (PRO) data to explore disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
