- 'Exclude - Exclusion Criteria:'
- 'Exclude - '
- Exclude - * Current participation or enrollment in another therapeutic clinical
  trial
- Exclude - * Any anticancer treatment within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to start
  of study treatment
- Exclude - * Whole brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to start of study treatment
- Exclude - * Stereotactic radiosurgery within 7 days prior to start of study treatment
- Exclude - * Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the
  study
- Exclude - * History of or concurrent serious medical condition or abnormality in
  clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the participant's
  safe participation in and completion of the study or confounds the ability to interpret
  data from the study
- Exclude - * Incomplete recovery from any surgery prior to the start of study treatment
  that would interfere with the determination of safety or efficacy of study treatment
- Exclude - * Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association
  cardiac disease (Class II or higher), myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular
  accident within 3 months prior to enrollment, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable
  angina
- Exclude - * History of another active cancer within 5 years prior to screening that
  may interfere with the determination of safety or efficacy of study treatment with
  respect to the qualifying solid tumor malignancy
- Exclude - * In addition to the general exclusion criteria above, in order to be
  enrolled in a treatment cohort of the study, participants must not meet any of the
  cohort-specific exclusion criteria

summary: TAPISTRY is a Phase II, global, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort study
  designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy
  as single agents or in rational, specified combinations in participants with unresectable,
  locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors determined to harbor specific oncogenic
  genomic alterations or who are tumor mutational burden (TMB)-high as identified
  by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Participants with solid tumors
  will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results
  at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their
  genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype,
  will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified,
  will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable
  toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever
  occurs first.
